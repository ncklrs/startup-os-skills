# GTM Leader

Strategic go-to-market expertise for SaaS companies — from positioning and channel selection to content systems and brand building.

## Philosophy

Great GTM isn't about being everywhere. It's about being **unmissable** where your customers already are.

The best SaaS GTM strategies:
1. **Start narrow, then expand** — Own one channel before adding another
2. **Build distribution before product** — Audience is a moat
3. **Compound over time** — Consistency beats virality
4. **Blend personal and brand** — Founders are the ultimate differentiator

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `strategy-*` — GTM fundamentals, motions, positioning
- `content-*` — Content systems, pillars, distribution
- `brand-*` — Personal brand vs business brand
- `platform-*` — Channel-specific tactics (LinkedIn, X, TikTok, YouTube)
- `growth-*` — Audience building, community, virality

## Core Frameworks

### GTM Motion Types

| Motion | Best For | Key Metric |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Product-Led (PLG)** | Self-serve, low ACV | Activation rate |
| **Sales-Led** | Enterprise, high ACV | SQL → Close rate |
| **Community-Led** | Developer tools, platforms | Community engagement |
| **Content-Led** | Thought leadership, SEO | Organic traffic |
| **Founder-Led** | Early stage, trust-building | Founder reach |

### The Content Pyramid

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │   Pillar    │  ← Long-form (blog, video, podcast)
                    │   Content   │
                    ├─────────────┤
                    │  Derivative │  ← Clips, threads, carousels
                    │   Content   │
                    ├─────────────┤
                    │   Atomic    │  ← Single posts, quotes, stats
                    │   Content   │
                    └─────────────┘
```

### PESO Model (Distribution)

- **Paid** — Ads, sponsorships, paid placement
- **Earned** — PR, press, organic mentions
- **Shared** — Social media, community
- **Owned** — Blog, email list, product

### Brand Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           BUSINESS BRAND                │
│    (Company positioning, voice, values) │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         PERSONAL BRANDS                 │
│   (Founders, employees, advocates)      │
│   ┌─────┐  ┌─────┐  ┌─────┐            │
│   │ CEO │  │ CTO │  │ Dev │            │
│   └─────┘  └─────┘  └─────┘            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Platform Overview

| Platform | Audience | Content Type | Cadence | Half-Life |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| **LinkedIn** | B2B professionals | Text, carousels, video | 3-5x/week | 24-48 hours |
| **X/Twitter** | Tech, media, thought leaders | Text, threads, memes | 3-10x/day | 20 minutes |
| **TikTok** | Gen Z, consumers, SMB | Short video | 1-3x/day | 7 days |
| **YouTube** | Researchers, learners | Long video, Shorts | 1-2x/week | Years |
| **Newsletter** | Engaged subscribers | Long-form, curated | 1x/week | N/A (inbox) |
| **Podcast** | Commuters, learners | Audio conversations | 1x/week | Months |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Platform FOMO** — Being mediocre everywhere beats excellence somewhere
- **Content without distribution** — "Build it and they will come" doesn't work
- **Brand before audience** — Positioning means nothing if no one hears it
- **Copying competitors** — Being a second-rate them vs first-rate you
- **Vanity metrics** — Followers ≠ customers
- **Separating brand and product** — Your product IS your brand
