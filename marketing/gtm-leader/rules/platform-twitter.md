## X/Twitter Strategy

**Impact: HIGH**

X is where tech, media, and culture converge. Fastest for ideas, trends, and building relationships with influencers.

### X Algorithm 2024/2025

**What gets reach:**
- Replies and quote tweets (conversation)
- Content that keeps people on platform
- Early engagement velocity
- Blue checkmark (paid subscribers get boost)
- Images and videos

**What kills reach:**
- External links (massive penalty)
- Low engagement (tweets die in 20 min)
- Posting without engaging
- Too many hashtags
- Automated/scheduled feel

### Content Types Ranked

| Type | Reach | Effort | Best For |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Single tweet + image** | Highest | Low | Hot takes, announcements |
| **Thread** | High | Medium | Education, stories |
| **Quote tweet** | High | Low | Commentary |
| **Video (< 2 min)** | High | High | Demos, personal |
| **Reply (quality)** | Medium | Low | Building relationships |
| **Link tweet** | Low | Low | When necessary |

### The X Voice

X rewards personality. Be human.

**Works:**
```
- Lowercase is fine
- Contractions always
- Sentence fragments
- Hot takes
- Humor
- Self-deprecation
```

**Doesn't work:**
```
- Corporate speak
- Formal grammar
- "We are excited to announce"
- Buzzwords
- Over-polished
```

### Thread Structure

```
1/ [Hook that works as standalone tweet]

2/ [Context: why this matters]

3-8/ [The substance, one point per tweet]

9/ [Summary or key takeaway]

10/ [CTA: follow for more, check out X]

🧵/10 (optional: mark end)
```

**Thread tips:**
- First tweet must be compelling alone (it's shared separately)
- Number format: "1/" or "1."
- Each tweet should be valuable independently
- Use images every 3-4 tweets to break up text
- End with clear CTA

### Thread Hook Examples

```
1/ I spent 3 years building a product no one wanted.

Here's what I'd do differently (thread):

1/ The secret to raising a seed round isn't your deck.

It's this:

1/ "Senior engineer" doesn't mean what you think it means.

After hiring 50+ engineers, here's my take:

### Posting Strategy

**Cadence:**
- Minimum: 3-5 tweets/day
- Growth mode: 10-20 tweets/day
- Mix: 70% replies, 20% original, 10% threads

**Timing:**
- Morning: 7-9am (catch commuters)
- Lunch: 11am-1pm
- Evening: 5-7pm
- Tweets have ~20 min lifespan, so volume matters

### The Reply Strategy

**Best way to grow on X: reply to bigger accounts**

Target:
- Accounts with 10K-100K followers in your space
- Be early (within 30 min of their post)
- Add genuine value (not just "great post!")

**Good reply formula:**
```
[Agree/disagree + brief reason]
[Your experience or additional insight]
```

### X Threads to Steal

**Evergreen formats:**

```
"X things I learned doing Y"
"What nobody tells you about X"
"X tools/tips for Y"
"The biggest mistakes I made in X"
"How to X (step by step)"
"X vs Y: my honest take"
```

### Building Authority

1. **Find your 50** — 50 accounts in your space to engage with daily
2. **Reply thoughtfully** — Add value, not just "great point!"
3. **Create original threads** — 1-2 per week minimum
4. **Quote tweet with takes** — Show your perspective
5. **Be controversial (tastefully)** — Opinions > vanilla

### Linking Strategy

**Links kill reach. Options:**

```
Option 1: Link in reply
"Full guide in the first reply 👇"

Option 2: Bio link
"Link in bio for the full breakdown"

Option 3: Accept lower reach
Just post the link when it matters more than reach
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Posting and ghosting** — Engagement in first 20 min is critical
- **Too polished** — X rewards rough edges
- **Only self-promotion** — Mix in personality, replies, commentary
- **Hashtag stuffing** — 0-1 hashtags max
- **Automated feel** — Real-time > scheduled
