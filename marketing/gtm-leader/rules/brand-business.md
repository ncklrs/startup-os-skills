## Business Brand Strategy

**Impact: HIGH**

Business brand is how your company is perceived independent of any individual. It scales beyond founders.

### Personal Brand vs Business Brand

| Dimension | Personal Brand | Business Brand |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Voice | Individual, opinionated | Consistent, company-wide |
| Trust source | Human connection | Product experience |
| Portability | Goes with founder | Stays with company |
| Scale | Limited by founder time | Can scale with team |
| Content | Stories, opinions | Value, education, product |

### When to Invest in Each

**Heavy personal, light business:** Pre-seed to Series A
- Founder is the brand
- Customers buy the founder's vision
- Business brand = "founder's company"

**Balance both:** Series A to B
- Begin establishing company voice
- Train team to create content
- Founder still prominent

**Heavy business, support with personal:** Series B+
- Company brand carries weight
- Multiple personal brands (execs, employees)
- Business brand attracts enterprise

### Business Brand Elements

**1. Positioning Statement**
Internal north star for all communication.

```
SecretStash is the secrets management platform built for developers,
not security teams. We make security feel like a productivity feature,
not a compliance burden.
```

**2. Voice Attributes**
3-5 adjectives that guide all content.

```
SecretStash voice:
- Direct (not corporate)
- Helpful (not salesy)
- Technical (not dumbed down)
- Confident (not arrogant)
- Human (not robotic)
```

**3. Messaging Pillars**
Key claims you make consistently.

```
Pillar 1: "Security that doesn't slow you down"
Pillar 2: "Built for developers, loved by security teams"
Pillar 3: "From .env files to SOC 2 in minutes"
```

### Brand Voice in Action

**Corporate (bad):**
```
SecretStash is excited to announce the general availability of our
enterprise-grade secrets management solution, enabling organizations
to leverage best-in-class security practices.
```

**On-brand (good):**
```
Environments are here. Separate secrets for dev, staging, prod.
No more "was that the test database?" moments.
```

### Brand Consistency Checklist

| Touchpoint | Voice Consistent? |

```

### Competitive Positioning Map

Define where you sit relative to competitors:

```
                    Technical ↑
                              │
           ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
           │                  │    HashiCorp     │
           │                  │    Vault         │
Expensive ─┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┼─ Affordable
           │                  │                  │
           │   AWS Secrets    │   SecretStash    │
           │   Manager        │   (You Are Here) │
           └──────────────────┼──────────────────┘
                              │
                    Simple ───┘
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Voice by committee** — Reviewing every post until it's beige
- **Copycat positioning** — "We're like [competitor] but..."
- **Inconsistent voice** — Website sounds different from product
- **All features, no feeling** — Specs without personality
- **Brand before product** — Investing in brand when product is broken
