## LinkedIn Strategy

**Impact: HIGH**

LinkedIn is the highest-intent B2B platform. Your ICP is there and they're thinking about work.

### LinkedIn Algorithm 2024/2025

**What gets reach:**
- Native content (no external links in post)
- Dwell time (people stop scrolling to read)
- Early engagement (first hour matters most)
- Conversation (comments > reactions)
- Personal stories and opinions

**What kills reach:**
- External links in post body
- Engagement bait ("Like if you agree!")
- Tagging people who don't engage
- Posting and ghosting
- Corporate speak

### Content Formats Ranked

| Format | Reach Potential | Effort | Best For |
|--------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| **Text + image** | Highest | Low | Stories, insights |
| **Carousel** | High | Medium | Frameworks, how-tos |
| **Video (native)** | High | High | Tutorials, personal |
| **Text only** | Medium-High | Low | Hot takes, stories |
| **Document** | Medium | Medium | Guides, checklists |
| **Poll** | Medium | Low | Engagement, research |
| **Link post** | Low | Low | When necessary |
| **Reshare** | Lowest | None | Avoid |

### The Hook Formula

You have 2 lines before "see more." Make them count.

**Hook patterns that work:**

```
[Controversial statement]
"Unpopular opinion: .env files should be illegal"

[Specific number + outcome]
"I mass-deleted 47 API keys from Slack last week"

[Open loop]
"My biggest career mistake wasn't a failed startup.
It was this:"

[Direct challenge]
"If you're storing secrets in .env files, you're gambling"

[Story hook]
"Last Tuesday, I almost cost my company $50,000"
```

### Post Structure

**For text posts:**
```
[Hook - 1-2 lines]

[Line break]

[Story/Context - 3-5 lines]

[Line break]

[Insight/Lesson - 3-5 lines]

[Line break]

[Takeaway or question]
```

### Posting Cadence

| Approach | Posts/Week | Engagement/Day |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Minimum viable** | 3 | 15 min |
| **Growth mode** | 5 | 30 min |
| **Authority building** | 7 | 60 min |

**Best times:** 7-8am, 12pm, 5-6pm (target audience timezone)

### Carousel Best Practices

```
Slide 1: Hook (title that stops scroll)
Slide 2-8: Value (one point per slide)
Slide 9: Summary/recap
Slide 10: CTA (follow, comment, save)
```

- Use consistent branding
- Large text (readable on mobile)
- One idea per slide
- End with clear CTA

### LinkedIn Engagement Strategy

**The 5-3-2 Rule (daily):**
- 5 meaningful comments on others' posts
- 3 replies to comments on your posts
- 2 DM conversations

**Comment formula:**
```
[Agree/disagree + why]
[Add your experience]
[Question to continue conversation]
```

### Profile Optimization

| Element | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| **Headline** | Not job title. Value prop: "Helping developers secure secrets | Founder @SecretStash" |
| **Banner** | Product screenshot or key message |
| **About** | Story + what you share + CTA |
| **Featured** | Best posts, key content |
| **Experience** | Focus on current role |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Broetry** — One. Word. Lines. For. Effect.
- **Engagement pods** — Fake engagement hurts reach
- **Link in first comment** — Algorithm caught on, just put it there
- **Humble brags** — "So honored to be recognized..."
- **No personality** — Sounding like company PR
