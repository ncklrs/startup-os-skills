## SaaS Positioning

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Positioning is how you win the mental battle before the product battle. Own a category or create one.

### Positioning Formula

**For [target customer] who [has this problem], [Product] is the [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [competitors], we [differentiator].**

### The Three Positioning Strategies

**1. Category Leader**
Own an existing category. Be the best at what the category promises.

```
"The CRM for sales teams"
"The best project management tool"
```
*Requires: Being objectively better or having distribution advantage*

**2. Category Creator**
Define a new category. Make competition irrelevant.

```
"The first customer data platform"
"The modern data stack for startups"
```
*Requires: A genuinely new approach + marketing budget to educate market*

**3. Niche Dominator**
Own a specific segment of an existing category.

```
"The CRM for real estate agents"
"Project management for creative teams"
```
*Requires: Deep understanding of niche, willingness to say no to other segments*

### Positioning Canvas

| Element | Question | Example (SecretStash) |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| **Target** | Who specifically? | Developers at startups |
| **Problem** | What pain? | Secrets scattered in .env files, Slack, docs |
| **Category** | What are you? | Secrets management platform |
| **Benefit** | Why care? | Never leak a credential again |
| **Differentiator** | Why you? | Built for developers, not security teams |

### Good Positioning Examples

```
Notion: "The all-in-one workspace"
→ Category creator: Combined docs, wikis, databases

Linear: "The issue tracker built for modern teams"
→ Niche dominator: Issue tracking for startups who hate Jira

Vercel: "The frontend cloud"
→ Category creator: Named and owned the frontend deployment space

Figma: "Where teams design together"
→ Repositioned: From "design tool" to "collaboration platform"
```

### Bad Positioning Examples

```
"The AI-powered platform for modern teams"
→ Vague, could be anything

"We're like Salesforce but better"
→ Defining yourself by competitor

"The complete solution for all your needs"
→ No focus, no differentiation

"Innovative, scalable, enterprise-grade"
→ Buzzwords without meaning
```

### Testing Your Positioning

1. **5-second test** — Can someone explain what you do after 5 seconds on your homepage?
2. **Comparison test** — Is it clear how you're different from alternatives?
3. **Memory test** — Can customers describe you accurately to others?
4. **Believability test** — Can you actually deliver on the promise?

### Anti-Patterns

- **Position by features** — "We have AI and integrations" (so does everyone)
- **Position by technology** — "Built on Kubernetes" (customers don't care)
- **Position for everyone** — If everyone's your customer, no one is
- **Position by price** — "The affordable option" (race to bottom)
