## Personal Brand Strategy

**Impact: HIGH**

Personal brand is the highest-leverage GTM activity for founders. People follow people, not logos.

### Why Personal Brand Wins

| Brand Type | Trust Level | Reach | Cost | Longevity |
|------------|-------------|-------|------|-----------|
| **Personal** | High (human) | Unlimited (portable) | Low (time) | Follows you forever |
| **Company** | Lower (corporate) | Limited to company | High ($$$) | Dies with company |

### The Personal Brand Flywheel

```
Share insights → Build audience → Gain trust → Drive business → Get more insights → Share more
```

### Personal Brand Positioning

**You need a clear answer to: "What is [Name] known for?"**

| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Domain** | What topic? | Developer security |
| **Angle** | What perspective? | Making it practical, not paranoid |
| **Audience** | Who listens? | Startup CTOs and dev leads |
| **Format** | How do you share? | Threads and short videos |

### The 3-3-3 Content Mix

**3 types of content:**

1. **Expertise** (40%) — Your professional knowledge
   - How-tos, insights, frameworks
   - "Here's how we handle secrets rotation"

2. **Experience** (40%) — Your journey and lessons
   - Stories, failures, wins
   - "I once leaked an API key that cost us $50k"

3. **Personality** (20%) — Who you are as a human
   - Opinions, humor, life moments
   - "Unpopular opinion: Kubernetes is overkill for 90% of startups"

### Building in Public

**What to share:**
- Product development decisions
- Revenue/growth milestones (with context)
- Failures and lessons
- Behind-the-scenes process
- Customer conversations (anonymized)

**What NOT to share:**
- Confidential customer data
- Competitive intelligence
- Team conflicts
- Unverified claims
- Anything you'd regret in 5 years

### Personal Brand Metrics

**Vanity (track but don't optimize):**
- Follower count
- Impressions

**Meaningful (optimize these):**
- Engagement rate (comments, replies)
- DM conversations started
- Inbound opportunities (investors, customers, talent)
- Brand search volume

### Scaling Personal Brand

| Stage | Time Investment | Activities |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| **Building** | 10+ hrs/week | Daily posting, heavy engagement |
| **Growing** | 5-7 hrs/week | Consistent posting, strategic engagement |
| **Maintaining** | 2-3 hrs/week | Quality over quantity, leverage team |

### Anti-Patterns

- **All company, no person** — Sounding like a press release
- **All personal, no expertise** — Selfies without substance
- **Fake authenticity** — Manufactured vulnerability
- **Inconsistency** — Posting daily, then disappearing for months
- **Platform dependence** — Not building email list as backup
