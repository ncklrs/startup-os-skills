## Content Pillars

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Content pillars are the 3-5 topics you'll own. Everything you create should ladder up to a pillar.

### What Content Pillars Do

- **Focus** — Say no to off-topic content
- **Authority** — Become known for specific expertise
- **SEO** — Cluster content around core topics
- **Consistency** — Never wonder "what should I post?"

### Choosing Your Pillars

**The 3-Circle Method:**

```
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │  What you know  │
        │    deeply       │
        └────────┬────────┘
                 │
    ┌────────────┼────────────┐
    │            │            │
    ▼            ▼            ▼
┌───────┐   ┌───────┐   ┌───────┐

│product│◄─►│ HERE  │◄─►│ ICP   │
│solves │   │       │   │ cares │
└───────┘   └───────┘   └───────┘
```

**Pillars live at the intersection of:**
1. What you know deeply (credibility)
2. What your product solves (relevance)
3. What your ICP cares about (attention)

### Example: SecretStash Pillars

| Pillar | Topics | Content Types |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Secrets Management** | Best practices, comparisons, tutorials | How-tos, guides, comparisons |
| **DevSecOps** | Shifting left, security culture, automation | Opinion pieces, trends |
| **Developer Productivity** | Workflows, tooling, onboarding | Tips, listicles, stories |
| **Startup Security** | Compliance, SOC 2, scaling | Guides, checklists |
| **Building in Public** | Product updates, lessons, transparency | Personal stories, updates |

### Content Pillar Matrix

For each pillar, plan content across formats:

| Pillar | Blog | LinkedIn | X/Twitter | Video |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Secrets Mgmt | Deep guides | Key insights | Quick tips | Tutorials |
| DevSecOps | Trends analysis | Hot takes | Debates | Interviews |
| Dev Productivity | How-tos | Carousels | Threads | Demos |
| Startup Security | Checklists | Stories | Memes | Walkthroughs |

### Pillar Content Ratio

```
Primary pillar (your core expertise):     40%
Secondary pillars (adjacent topics):      40%
Wild cards (trends, experiments):         20%
```

### Validating Pillars

**Search test:** Do people search for this?
**Conversation test:** Do people talk about this?
**Authority test:** Can you credibly own this?
**Competition test:** Is it too crowded?
**Product test:** Does it relate to what you sell?

### Evolving Pillars

Pillars should evolve as you grow:

```
Early Stage:
- Building in public (founder story)
- Core problem you solve
- Adjacent skill/expertise

Growth Stage:
- Category leadership topics
- Customer success stories
- Industry trends

Scale Stage:
- Thought leadership / contrarian takes
- Research and data
- Ecosystem/platform topics
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Too many pillars** — 3-5 max, not 10
- **Pillars too broad** — "Technology" vs "DevSecOps for startups"
- **No product connection** — Content that doesn't lead anywhere
- **Chasing trends** — Abandoning pillars for viral topics
