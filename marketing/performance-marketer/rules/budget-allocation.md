## Budget Allocation

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Smart budget allocation maximizes return. Dumb allocation wastes money on channels that don't convert.

### The 70-20-10 Rule

| Bucket | % of Budget | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Proven** | 70% | Scale what's working |
| **Optimization** | 20% | Test variations of winners |
| **Experimentation** | 10% | Try new channels/approaches |

### Budget Allocation by Funnel

| Stage | % of Budget | Goal |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **TOFU** (Awareness) | 15-25% | Build audience, brand |
| **MOFU** (Consideration) | 25-35% | Generate leads, engagement |
| **BOFU** (Decision) | 40-60% | Convert to customers |

### Channel Budget Framework

Allocate based on performance data:

```
Total Budget: $50,000/month

Channel Performance:
┌────────────────┬──────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────┐
│ Channel        │ CAC  │ LTV  │ LTV:CAC │ Recommend │
├────────────────┼──────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────┤
│ Google Search  │ $120 │ $600 │ 5:1     │ Scale ↑   │
│ Meta Ads       │ $80  │ $240 │ 3:1     │ Maintain  │
│ LinkedIn       │ $350 │ $800 │ 2.3:1   │ Test more │
│ Content/SEO    │ $40  │ $500 │ 12.5:1  │ Invest ↑  │
└────────────────┴──────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────┘

Allocation:
• Google Search: $20,000 (40%) — Best ROAS, scale
• Meta Ads: $15,000 (30%) — Profitable, maintain
• Content/SEO: $8,000 (16%) — Best LTV, invest
• LinkedIn: $5,000 (10%) — Testing, optimize
• Experiments: $2,000 (4%) — New channels
```

### Scaling Thresholds

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| LTV:CAC > 3:1 | Profitable | Scale budget 20-30%/week |
| LTV:CAC 2-3:1 | Marginal | Optimize before scaling |
| LTV:CAC 1-2:1 | Risky | Pause, fix fundamentals |
| LTV:CAC < 1:1 | Unprofitable | Stop spending |

### Scaling Strategy

```
Week 1: $1,000/day (baseline)
Week 2: $1,200/day (+20% if performance stable)
Week 3: $1,400/day (+17% if performance stable)
Week 4: $1,700/day (+21% if performance stable)

If CAC increases >15%: Hold and optimize
If CAC increases >30%: Reduce budget 20%
```

### Budget Pacing

| Model | When to Use | How It Works |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Daily budget** | Consistent spend | Same amount each day |
| **Lifetime budget** | Campaigns with end date | Platform optimizes delivery |
| **Accelerated** | Time-sensitive | Spend fast, exhaust budget |
| **Standard** | Default | Even distribution |

### Good Budget Allocation

```
✓ Data-driven decisions
  → Shift budget based on CAC, not gut feel

✓ Regular rebalancing
  → Monthly review, quarterly strategy

✓ Seasonal adjustment
  → Increase for Q4, pull back in slow periods

✓ Test budget protected
  → 10% always for experimentation

✓ Runway consideration
  → Don't spend faster than you can afford
```

### Bad Budget Allocation

```
✗ Equal split across channels
  → Ignores performance differences

✗ Set and forget
  → Markets change, performance drifts

✗ All-in on one channel
  → Concentration risk, algorithm dependency

✗ Cutting based on gut
  → Let data drive decisions

✗ Scaling too fast
  → Algorithms need time to optimize
```

### Diminishing Returns

Every channel has a saturation point:

```
     Conversions
        │
        │        ╭───────────────
        │      ╱
        │    ╱   ← Diminishing returns zone
        │  ╱
        │╱______________________
        └────────────────────────▶
                   Spend

As spend increases:
• Audience exhaustion
• Higher CPM (auctions)
• Lower-quality placements
• Ad fatigue
```

### Signs You've Hit Diminishing Returns

- CAC increasing despite no changes
- CTR declining
- Frequency > 3 for same audience
- CPM rising significantly
- Conversion rate dropping

### Budget Optimization Levers

| Lever | When to Pull |
|-------|--------------|
| **Increase budget** | LTV:CAC > 3:1, stable 2+ weeks |
| **Decrease budget** | CAC rising, LTV:CAC < 2:1 |
| **Shift channels** | One channel outperforming |
| **Pause channel** | LTV:CAC < 1:1 after optimization |
| **Add channel** | Main channels at saturation |

### Monthly Budget Review

| Question | Source | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Which channels have best LTV:CAC? | Analytics | Increase allocation |
| Which channels degraded? | Week-over-week | Investigate/optimize |
| Are we hitting spend goals? | Platform reports | Adjust pacing |
| What's our blended CAC trend? | Dashboard | Scale/contract overall |
| What experiments ran? | Test log | Decide: scale or kill |

### Quarterly Budget Planning

```
1. Review performance by channel
   └── CAC, LTV:CAC, conversion volume

2. Analyze trends
   └── Improving, stable, or declining

3. Set targets
   └── Volume, efficiency, new channels

4. Allocate budget
   └── Based on LTV:CAC and goals

5. Plan experiments
   └── New channels, audiences, creative

6. Document assumptions
   └── CPM trends, seasonality, market changes
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Peanut buttering** — Equal budget across all channels
- **Chasing volume** — More spend doesn't mean more profit
- **Ignoring LTV:CAC** — Revenue focus misses efficiency
- **Scaling too fast** — Algorithms need learning time
- **No test budget** — Growth channels come from experiments
- **Reactive cuts** — Week-over-week swings are normal
- **Platform default budgets** — Often too high for new campaigns
