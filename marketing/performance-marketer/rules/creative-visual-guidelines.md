## Visual Creative Guidelines

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Visuals stop the scroll before copy can convert. Strong creative can improve performance 2-5x.

### Platform Image Specifications

| Platform | Recommended Size | Aspect Ratio | Max File Size |
|----------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Meta Feed** | 1080 × 1080 | 1:1 | 30MB |
| **Meta Stories** | 1080 × 1920 | 9:16 | 30MB |
| **LinkedIn Feed** | 1200 × 627 | 1.91:1 | 5MB |
| **LinkedIn Carousel** | 1080 × 1080 | 1:1 | 10MB |
| **Google Display** | 1200 × 628, 300 × 250 | Various | 150KB |
| **Twitter/X** | 1200 × 675 | 16:9 | 5MB |

### Video Specifications

| Platform | Recommended Length | Aspect Ratio | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| **Meta Feed** | 15-30 sec | 1:1 or 4:5 | Hook in first 3 sec |
| **Meta Stories/Reels** | 15 sec | 9:16 | Sound-on optimized |
| **LinkedIn** | 30-90 sec | 1:1 or 16:9 | Captions required |
| **YouTube Ads** | 15-30 sec (skippable) | 16:9 | Hook before skip |
| **TikTok** | 15-60 sec | 9:16 | Native, authentic feel |

### Creative Principles

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Thumb-stopping** | Interrupt the scroll pattern | Motion, contrast, faces |
| **Message match** | Creative matches ad copy | Same headline, same offer |
| **Mobile-first** | Designed for small screens | Large text, simple visuals |
| **Platform-native** | Feels like organic content | TikTok style for TikTok |
| **Focused** | One message per creative | Don't cram features |

### Creative Types That Work

| Type | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **UGC-style** | Authenticity, social proof | Customer testimonial video |
| **Product demo** | Complex products, SaaS | Screen recording with narration |
| **Before/After** | Transformation products | Side-by-side comparison |
| **Founder story** | Trust building, B2B | Founder speaking to camera |
| **Data visualization** | Credibility, statistics | Animated chart, stat callout |
| **Social proof** | Trust, FOMO | Logos, customer count, reviews |
| **Comparison** | Differentiation | You vs competitors |

### Good Creative Examples

```
✓ Static Image:
- Clear headline (4-7 words max)
- Product screenshot or illustration
- Brand colors, no clutter
- CTA button visible

✓ Video:
- Hook in first 2 seconds
- Problem statement by second 5
- Solution demo seconds 5-20
- CTA and social proof at end
- Captions/subtitles throughout

✓ Carousel:
- Slide 1: Hook + curiosity gap
- Slides 2-4: Value/benefit/proof
- Final slide: CTA + offer
```

### Bad Creative Examples

```
✗ Wall of text on image
  → Unreadable on mobile, low engagement

✗ Generic stock photos
  → Blend in with organic content

✗ Slow video intro with logo
  → Lost audience before message

✗ Multiple CTAs in one creative
  → Confuses the action

✗ Tiny product screenshots
  → Can't see on mobile

✗ Off-brand creative
  → Damages brand recognition
```

### Text-on-Image Rules

| Platform | Text Recommendation |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Meta** | <20% of image is text (old rule, still good practice) |
| **LinkedIn** | Minimal text, rely on post copy |
| **Google Display** | Clear, legible, high contrast |
| **Twitter/X** | Optional, tweet carries message |

### Creative Testing Framework

| Element | Test | Measure |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Image type** | Photo vs illustration vs product | CTR |
| **Color scheme** | Dark vs light, brand vs contrast | CTR, engagement |
| **Headline position** | Top vs bottom vs overlay | CTR |
| **Face vs no face** | People vs product only | CTR |
| **Static vs motion** | Image vs GIF vs video | CTR, CPM |

### Mobile Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Text readable at 50% size
- [ ] Key message visible without full-screen
- [ ] CTAs fingertip-sized (min 44×44px)
- [ ] Loads fast (<3 seconds)
- [ ] Looks good in feed preview
- [ ] Sound-off friendly (captions for video)

### Anti-Patterns

- **Stock photo syndrome** — Generic images blend into feed
- **Logo-first design** — Nobody cares about your logo
- **Desktop-designed** — 85%+ traffic is mobile
- **Too much information** — One message per creative
- **Ignoring safe zones** — Platform UI covers edges
- **No variation** — Same creative fatigues fast
