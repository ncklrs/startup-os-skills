## Ad Copy Best Practices

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Your ad copy has 1-3 seconds to stop the scroll. Every word must earn its place.

### The Ad Copy Formula

```
Hook (Attention) → Value (Interest) → Proof (Trust) → CTA (Action)
```

### Platform-Specific Formats

| Platform | Primary Text | Headline | Description |
|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **Google Search** | N/A | 30 chars × 3 | 90 chars × 2 |
| **Meta** | 125 chars visible | 27 chars | 27 chars |
| **LinkedIn** | 150 chars visible | 70 chars | 100 chars |
| **Twitter/X** | 280 chars total | N/A | N/A |

### Hook Formulas That Work

| Formula | Example | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Question** | "Still using spreadsheets for [X]?" | Pain point awareness |
| **Statistic** | "87% of teams waste 5 hours/week on [X]" | Credibility-first |
| **Contrarian** | "Why most [X] advice is wrong" | Thought leadership |
| **Result** | "How we got 10k signups in 30 days" | Case study style |
| **Direct** | "The fastest way to [achieve goal]" | High-intent search |
| **FOMO** | "Join 5,000+ teams already using [X]" | Social proof |

### Good Ad Copy

```
✓ Google Search Ad:
Headline 1: "Automate Your Secrets Management"
Headline 2: "Start Free, No Credit Card"
Headline 3: "SOC 2 Compliant"
Description: "Stop hardcoding API keys. Sync secrets across environments in minutes. Trusted by 10,000+ developers."

✓ Meta Ad (Primary Text):
"I used to spend 3 hours every Monday updating .env files across 12 repos.

Now it takes 30 seconds.

SecretStash syncs your secrets automatically. One source of truth. Zero copy-paste.

→ Free for teams under 5"

✓ LinkedIn Ad:
"Engineering leaders: Your developers are storing secrets in Slack.

We surveyed 500 teams. 73% had credentials in chat history.

Here's how to fix it without slowing down your team:
[Link]"
```

### Bad Ad Copy

```
✗ "We're excited to announce our revolutionary platform!"
  → Nobody cares about your excitement

✗ "Best-in-class solution for enterprise needs"
  → Empty jargon, no specifics

✗ "Click here to learn more"
  → Vague CTA, no value proposition

✗ "SecretStash | Secrets Management | API Keys | .env"
  → Keyword stuffing, not copywriting

✗ "Our award-winning team has developed..."
  → Talks about you, not them
```

### CTA Hierarchy (Commitment Level)

| CTA | Commitment | Best For |
|-----|------------|----------|
| "Get the guide" | Low | TOFU, awareness |
| "Start free trial" | Medium | MOFU, consideration |
| "Book a demo" | Medium-High | BOFU, B2B |
| "Buy now" | High | BOFU, clear intent |
| "Join waitlist" | Low | Pre-launch |

### Copy Testing Priority

Test these elements in order:
1. **Hook/Opening line** — Highest impact on CTR
2. **Value proposition** — What makes you different
3. **CTA** — What you want them to do
4. **Social proof** — Numbers, logos, testimonials
5. **Offer** — Free trial vs demo vs buy

### Character Count Cheat Sheet

| Element | Recommendation | Why |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Headlines | Under 30 chars | Displays fully on mobile |
| Primary text | Under 100 chars | Above "See more" fold |
| CTAs | 2-4 words | Clear and scannable |
| Numbers | Specific, not rounded | "847" beats "850+" |

### Emotional Triggers

| Trigger | Example | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Fear** | "Your secrets are exposed" | Security products |
| **Curiosity** | "The method 10x engineers use" | Educational content |
| **Urgency** | "Offer ends Friday" | Limited promotions |
| **Belonging** | "Join 50,000+ developers" | Community products |
| **Achievement** | "Ship 2x faster" | Productivity tools |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Feature-first copy** — Lead with benefit, not feature
- **We/us language** — They care about themselves
- **Multiple CTAs** — One ad, one action
- **Clever over clear** — Wordplay that confuses
- **Lying or exaggerating** — Destroys trust permanently
- **Ignoring platform norms** — LinkedIn ≠ TikTok ≠ Search
