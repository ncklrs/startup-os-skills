## Paid Ads Strategy

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Strategic paid advertising is about putting the right message in front of the right audience at the right time. Get this wrong, and no amount of optimization saves you.

### Channel Selection Framework

| Channel | When to Use | When to Avoid |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Google Search** | High-intent keywords exist, ready-to-buy audience | Brand new category, no search volume |
| **Google Display** | Retargeting, broad awareness | Direct response without retargeting |
| **Meta (FB/IG)** | Visual products, B2C, precise demographics | Complex B2B, very niche audiences |
| **LinkedIn** | B2B, job title targeting, enterprise | Low ACV products (<$1k), B2C |
| **Twitter/X** | Tech audiences, real-time trends | Broad consumer products |
| **TikTok** | Gen Z/Millennials, viral potential | B2B enterprise, 45+ demographics |
| **YouTube** | Demos, tutorials, brand building | Quick direct response |

### Campaign Structure

```
Account
├── Campaign (Objective + Budget)
│   ├── Ad Set/Group (Audience + Placement)
│   │   ├── Ad (Creative + Copy)
│   │   └── Ad (Variation)
│   └── Ad Set/Group (Different Audience)
└── Campaign (Different Objective)
```

### Audience Targeting Hierarchy

| Layer | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Core** | Demographics, interests, behaviors | "SaaS founders, 25-45" |
| **Custom** | Your data (site visitors, email lists) | "Visited pricing page" |
| **Lookalike** | Similar to your best customers | "1% lookalike of purchasers" |
| **Retargeting** | Re-engage known visitors | "Cart abandoners, 7 days" |

### Good Campaign Strategy

```
✓ Start with bottom-of-funnel audiences
  → Highest intent, fastest learnings

✓ Use separate campaigns for prospecting vs retargeting
  → Different budgets, different optimization goals

✓ Match campaign objective to business goal
  → Conversions for sales, Reach for awareness

✓ Test one variable at a time
  → Audience OR creative, not both simultaneously
```

### Bad Campaign Strategy

```
✗ Running all traffic to homepage
  → No message match, kills conversion rate

✗ Targeting "all ages, all interests"
  → Algorithm has nothing to optimize toward

✗ One campaign for everything
  → Can't allocate budget properly

✗ Copying competitor campaigns exactly
  → Their audience isn't your audience

✗ Starting with lookalikes before having seed data
  → Need 1,000+ conversions for quality lookalikes
```

### Budget Allocation by Funnel Stage

| Stage | % of Budget | Focus |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **TOFU** (Awareness) | 20-30% | Reach, brand lift |
| **MOFU** (Consideration) | 30-40% | Engagement, leads |
| **BOFU** (Decision) | 30-50% | Conversions, sales |

### Campaign Launch Checklist

- [ ] Clear objective defined (conversions, leads, awareness)
- [ ] Audience research completed
- [ ] Conversion tracking verified
- [ ] Landing page live and tested
- [ ] Creative assets prepared (multiple variations)
- [ ] Budget set with daily/lifetime caps
- [ ] Bid strategy selected (manual vs auto)
- [ ] Exclusions set (competitors, existing customers)
- [ ] UTM parameters configured
- [ ] Reporting dashboard ready

### Anti-Patterns

- **Premature scaling** — Algorithm needs 50+ conversions/week to optimize
- **Audience overlap** — Campaigns competing against each other
- **Wrong objective** — Optimizing for clicks when you want purchases
- **No exclusions** — Paying to advertise to existing customers
- **Platform default settings** — Audience Network/Display placements drain budget
