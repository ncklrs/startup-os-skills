## Anchoring and Framing

**Impact: CRITICAL**

The first price a customer sees becomes their reference point for all other prices. Use anchoring intentionally, or it will work against you.

### How Anchoring Works

```
Customer sees $499 first → $199 feels like a deal
Customer sees $99 first → $199 feels expensive
```

The anchor reframes everything that follows.

### Anchoring Strategies

| Strategy | How It Works | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **High-low anchor** | Show premium first, target looks cheap | List Enterprise at $999, Pro looks reasonable at $199 |
| **Crossed-out price** | Original price as anchor | ~~$299~~ $199/mo |
| **Competitor anchor** | Position against expensive alternative | "Competitors charge $500/mo" |
| **Value anchor** | Quantify the value delivered | "Saves 10 hours/week ($500 in labor)" |
| **Annual anchor** | Show annual total, monthly feels small | "$1,188/year = just $99/mo" |

### Framing Techniques

| Frame | Example | Psychology |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Gain frame** | "Save 20%" | Positive outcome |
| **Loss frame** | "Don't lose $1,200/year" | Loss aversion |
| **Time frame** | "$3.25/day" | Smaller perceived cost |
| **Value frame** | "Less than a coffee per day" | Relatable comparison |
| **Investment frame** | "ROI in 30 days" | Expected return |

### Price Display Hierarchy

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         RECOMMENDED (Anchor + Push)         │
│   ┌────────┐  ┌────────┐  ┌────────┐       │
│   │STARTER │  │  PRO   │  │ENTERPRISE│      │
│   │  $49   │  │  $99   │  │   $299   │      │
│   │        │  │ ★ BEST │  │          │      │
│   │        │  │  VALUE │  │          │      │
│   └────────┘  └────────┘  └────────┘       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Show plans left-to-right, ascending price.
Highlight middle tier. Enterprise anchors high.
```

### Good Anchoring Examples

```
✓ Pricing page order: Enterprise → Pro → Starter
  → Enterprise price anchors high, Starter feels cheap

✓ "Companies using spreadsheets spend 10+ hours per week on this.
    Our tool does it in 10 minutes for $99/mo."
  → Time-value anchor makes price feel small

✓ "Salesforce charges $300/user. We charge $30."
  → Competitor anchor + 10x value perception

✓ "Annual plan: $948/year — that's just $79/mo (2 months free)"
  → Shows savings, monthly feels affordable

✓ "Starting at $29/mo"
  → Low anchor to capture price-sensitive visitors
```

### Bad Anchoring Examples

```
✗ Showing cheapest plan first with no higher anchor
  → $29 becomes the expectation, $99 feels expensive

✗ "Our enterprise plan is $999/mo" (with no context)
  → Sticker shock, no value anchor

✗ Hiding prices entirely "Contact for pricing"
  → Creates anxiety, filters out good leads

✗ Showing crossed-out prices that aren't credible
  → ~~$999~~ $49 looks like a scam

✗ Using anchors that dwarf your price too much
  → "Competitors charge $10,000" for a $20 product seems absurd
```

### The Decoy Effect (Asymmetric Dominance)

Add a third option that makes your target option look better:

```
Without Decoy:
├── Basic: $99 (10 users)
└── Pro: $249 (unlimited users)
    Many choose Basic (cheaper)

With Decoy:
├── Basic: $99 (10 users)
├── Plus: $199 (15 users) ← Decoy
└── Pro: $249 (unlimited users)
    Pro now looks like much better value
```

### Decoy Construction Rules

| Element | Decoy Strategy |
|---------|----------------|
| **Price** | Close to target tier |
| **Features** | Slightly worse than target |
| **Value ratio** | Poor compared to target |
| **Purpose** | Make target look superior |

### Framing by Customer Segment

| Segment | Best Frame | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Price-sensitive** | Savings, value | "Save 40% vs competitors" |
| **Time-starved** | Time savings | "Get 10 hours back per week" |
| **Risk-averse** | Security, guarantee | "30-day money-back guarantee" |
| **Growth-focused** | ROI, scale | "10x your output in 90 days" |
| **Enterprise** | Total cost of ownership | "Lower TCO than building in-house" |

### Context-Dependent Anchors

| Context | Anchor Strategy |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Homepage** | Value proposition, savings |
| **Pricing page** | Tier comparison, best value |
| **Checkout** | Annual savings, upgrade benefits |
| **Upgrade modal** | Current limitation, unlock message |
| **Enterprise page** | Competitor costs, custom value |

### Psychological Price Points

| Price Point | Perception | Best For |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| **$9** | Impulse, low commitment | Add-ons, trials |
| **$29** | Accessible, entry-level | Starter tiers |
| **$49-79** | Serious but affordable | Solo/SMB |
| **$99** | Threshold, significant | Core product |
| **$199-299** | Premium, team-level | Growth stage |
| **$499+** | Enterprise-adjacent | Mid-market |
| **Custom** | True enterprise | High-touch sales |

### Anti-Patterns

- **No anchor at all** — Customer uses their own (usually lower)
- **Anchor too extreme** — $10,000 anchor for $100 product lacks credibility
- **Inconsistent anchoring** — Different anchors across pages confuse
- **Negative framing overuse** — Too much "don't lose" feels manipulative
- **Ignoring segment context** — Enterprise doesn't care about "coffee per day"
- **Static anchoring** — Not testing different anchor strategies
- **Forgetting the baseline** — What are they comparing you to?
