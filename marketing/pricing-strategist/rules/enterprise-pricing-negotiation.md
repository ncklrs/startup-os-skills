## Enterprise Pricing and Negotiation

**Impact: HIGH**

Enterprise deals require different pricing psychology, longer sales cycles, and strategic negotiation. The goal is value-based pricing, not cost-plus or competitive matching.

### Enterprise vs Self-Serve Differences

| Dimension | Self-Serve | Enterprise |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Decision maker** | Individual/team | Committee/procurement |
| **Sales cycle** | Minutes to days | Weeks to months |
| **Pricing** | Published, fixed | Custom, negotiated |
| **Payment** | Credit card | Invoice, PO, wire |
| **Contract** | Click-through | Custom MSA |
| **Support** | Self-serve/email | Dedicated CSM |
| **Discount** | None/minimal | Expected, structured |

### Enterprise Feature Gates

| Feature | Why Gate It | Enterprise Need |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **SSO/SAML** | Security requirement | IT compliance |
| **SCIM provisioning** | User management | Scale |
| **Audit logs** | Compliance tracking | Security |
| **Custom SLA** | Uptime guarantees | Risk mitigation |
| **Dedicated support** | Priority access | Business continuity |
| **Custom contracts** | Legal requirements | Procurement |
| **Data residency** | Regulatory compliance | Privacy laws |
| **On-prem/VPC** | Security requirements | Sensitive industries |

### Value-Based Pricing Framework

```
Enterprise Price = Value Delivered × Capture Rate

Value Delivered:
├── Time saved (hours × hourly rate)
├── Risk reduced (cost of incident × probability)
├── Revenue enabled (additional revenue attributable)
└── Costs avoided (vs alternative solutions)

Capture Rate: 10-30% of value (typical)
```

### Calculating Enterprise Value

| Value Driver | Calculation | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Time savings** | Hours saved × fully-loaded cost × users | 5 hrs/wk × $75/hr × 100 users = $1.95M/yr |
| **Risk reduction** | Breach cost × probability reduction | $4M breach × 5% reduction = $200K |
| **Revenue lift** | Revenue × attributed improvement | $10M ARR × 2% lift = $200K |
| **Alternative cost** | Cost of next-best alternative | Build internally: $500K/yr |

### Enterprise Discount Structure

| Commitment | Typical Discount | Why It Works |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Multi-year** | 10-25% off annual | Predictable revenue |
| **Upfront payment** | 5-15% additional | Cash flow benefit |
| **Volume (seats)** | 10-30% tier break | Encourages expansion |
| **Bundle** | 10-20% for suite | Increases ACV, stickiness |

### Good Discount Structure

```
✓ Multi-Year Pricing:
├── 1 year: $150,000/year (full price)
├── 2 years: $135,000/year (10% off)
└── 3 years: $120,000/year (20% off)

✓ Volume Tiers:
├── 1-50 seats: $50/seat/mo
├── 51-200 seats: $45/seat/mo (10% off)
├── 201-500 seats: $40/seat/mo (20% off)
└── 500+ seats: Custom pricing
```

### Bad Discount Practices

```
✗ Unlimited negotiation:
"We can do whatever you need on price"
→ No anchor, race to bottom

✗ Discounting without getting something:
"Fine, 30% off, same terms"
→ Leaving money on table

✗ Visible desperation:
"Quarter ends Friday, I can do 50% off today only"
→ Signals weakness, trains future behavior

✗ Inconsistent across customers:
Customer A pays $100K, Customer B pays $50K for same thing
→ Destroys trust when discovered
```

### Negotiation Levers

| What You Give | What You Get |
|---------------|--------------|
| Multi-year discount | Longer commitment |
| Volume discount | More seats committed |
| Implementation credits | Faster decision |
| Extended trial | More stakeholder buy-in |
| Price lock | Case study/reference rights |
| Payment terms | Larger upfront payment |

### Negotiation Best Practices

| Phase | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| **Discovery** | Understand their budget, timeline, alternatives |
| **Anchoring** | Start with full list price, justify with value |
| **Concession** | Never give without getting |
| **Timing** | Create urgency without desperation |
| **Walk-away** | Know your minimum, be willing to walk |

### Enterprise Pricing Page Copy

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Price display** | "Custom" or "Contact sales" |
| **CTA** | "Talk to sales" or "Request a demo" |
| **Feature list** | Full list with enterprise highlights |
| **Social proof** | Enterprise logos, case studies |
| **SLA/security** | Compliance badges, certifications |

### Good Enterprise Page Copy

```
✓ Tier card:
ENTERPRISE
"For organizations with advanced security needs"

• Everything in Pro, plus:
• SSO with SAML 2.0
• SCIM user provisioning
• 99.99% uptime SLA
• Dedicated success manager
• Custom contract terms
• SOC 2 Type II compliant

[Talk to Sales]
"Get a custom quote for your team"
```

### Bad Enterprise Page Copy

```
✗ "Enterprise Plan: Contact Us"
  → No value proposition, no feature list

✗ "For big companies with big needs"
  → Vague, not professional

✗ "Price: $$$$$"
  → Looks ridiculous

✗ "[Get Quote]" button only
  → No context on what enterprise includes
```

### Contract Elements

| Element | Standard | Enterprise Needs |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Term** | Month-to-month | Annual or multi-year |
| **Payment** | Credit card | Invoice, NET 30-60 |
| **SLA** | Best effort | Defined uptime + credits |
| **Support** | Standard | Premium with SLAs |
| **Security** | Standard | Custom security addendum |
| **Liability** | Limited | Negotiated caps |
| **Termination** | Anytime | For cause, notice period |

### Handling Common Objections

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Too expensive" | Reframe to value: ROI, TCO comparison |
| "Competitor is cheaper" | Differentiate on value, not price |
| "We need a discount" | "What commitment can you make for that?" |
| "Budget isn't approved" | "What would make this a priority?" |
| "We need to think about it" | "What specific concerns can I address?" |
| "We want monthly" | Show annual savings, offer shorter initial term |

### Good Objection Handling

```
Objection: "Your competitor offers the same thing for 30% less."

Response: "I understand price is important. Let me share what I've
heard from customers who evaluated both:

1. Our implementation takes 2 weeks vs their 2 months
2. Our uptime is 99.99% vs their 99.5%
3. Our SSO supports 15 providers vs their 3

The 30% savings often costs more in the long run. Would it help
if I connected you with a customer who evaluated both?"
```

### Pricing Committee/Approval Tips

| Strategy | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Build internal champion** | They'll fight for budget internally |
| **Arm them with ROI** | Give them the talking points |
| **Address IT/Security** | Proactive on concerns |
| **Executive alignment** | Ensure top-down buy-in |
| **Clear timeline** | Creates urgency without pressure |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Discounting first** — Start high, never start low
- **Feature-matching competitors** — Compete on value, not features
- **Ignoring procurement** — They have power, treat them well
- **No walk-away point** — Willing to lose bad deals
- **Price in email** — Complex pricing needs conversation
- **Same pitch to everyone** — Customize to their specific value drivers
- **Forgetting expansion** — Land price matters less than expand potential
- **Rushing the process** — Enterprise takes time, respect the cycle
