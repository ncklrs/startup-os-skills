## Decoy Pricing and Charm Numbers

**Impact: HIGH**

Strategic use of decoy options and number psychology can significantly shift buyer behavior without changing your actual product offering.

### The Decoy Effect Explained

A decoy is an option designed to make another option more attractive, not to be chosen itself.

```
The Economist Example (Famous Study):

Option A: Web-only $59
Option B: Print-only $125          ← Decoy
Option C: Web + Print $125

Without B: 68% chose A, 32% chose C
With B: 16% chose A, 84% chose C

The decoy shifted preference dramatically.
```

### Decoy Construction Framework

| Decoy Type | Structure | Effect |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| **Asymmetric dominance** | Similar price, fewer features | Target looks superior |
| **Compromise effect** | Extreme option on each end | Middle becomes "safe" |
| **Attraction effect** | Close to target but worse | Target more attractive |

### Building Effective Decoys

| Component | Decoy Property | Target Property |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Price** | Similar or slightly lower | Same or slightly higher |
| **Features** | Clearly inferior subset | Complete package |
| **Value ratio** | Poor $/feature | Strong $/feature |
| **Perception** | "Why would I choose this?" | "This is obviously better" |

### Good Decoy Examples

```
✓ Storage Plans:
├── 5GB: $4.99/mo
├── 15GB: $9.99/mo    ← Decoy (3x storage for 2x price)
└── 50GB: $12.99/mo   ← Target (10x storage for ~2.6x price)
  → 50GB looks like incredible value

✓ Consulting Packages:
├── 2 hours: $500
├── 5 hours: $1,000    ← Decoy ($200/hr)
└── 10 hours: $1,500   ← Target ($150/hr)
  → 10-hour package is obviously best deal

✓ Subscription Tiers:
├── Basic: $29 (5 users)
├── Team: $79 (10 users) ← Decoy ($7.90/user)
└── Pro: $99 (25 users)  ← Target ($3.96/user)
  → Pro offers 2x value for 25% more
```

### Bad Decoy Examples

```
✗ Decoy too similar to target:
├── $49: 10 features
├── $54: 11 features  ← Too close, not useful
└── $59: 15 features
  → Difference isn't stark enough

✗ Decoy is actually better value:
├── $29: 5GB
├── $49: 25GB     ← Oops, this is best value
└── $99: 40GB
  → Decoy became the preferred choice

✗ Decoy is too obviously fake:
├── $10: Full product
├── $500: Same product but blue  ← Absurd
└── $15: Full product + support
  → Customers see manipulation, lose trust
```

### Charm Pricing (9-Ending Prices)

Research shows prices ending in 9 are perceived as significantly cheaper:

| Price | Perceived As | Research Finding |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| **$39** vs $40 | ~15-20% cheaper | Left-digit effect |
| **$99** vs $100 | Different category | Crossing threshold |
| **$199** vs $200 | "One hundred something" | Anchors to lower hundred |

### When to Use Charm Pricing

| Context | Use Charm (9s) | Use Round Numbers |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Consumer/SMB** | Yes, increases conversion | Less effective |
| **Enterprise** | Avoid, looks cheap | Yes, signals quality |
| **Discounts** | Yes, $199 "feels right" | No |
| **Premium tiers** | Maybe $299 | $300 signals premium |
| **Psychological threshold** | $99 < $100 | $1,000 sounds prestigious |

### Price Ending Psychology

| Ending | Perception | Best For |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **X9** | Bargain, value | Mass market, discounts |
| **X5** | Balanced, fair | Mid-tier, straightforward |
| **X0** | Premium, round | Enterprise, luxury |
| **X7** | Specific, calculated | Data-driven feel |
| **X.99** | Consumer, retail | Low-cost, impulse |

### Good Charm Pricing Examples

```
✓ $29/mo for Starter plan
  → Under $30 threshold, accessible

✓ $99/mo for Pro plan
  → Under $100, "two-digit" pricing

✓ $299/mo for Business plan
  → Under $300, still feels "hundreds"

✓ "From $9.99/month"
  → Single-digit anchor, consumer-friendly

✓ Enterprise at $1,000/mo (round)
  → Premium feel, serious business
```

### Bad Charm Pricing Examples

```
✗ Enterprise plan at $4,999/mo
  → Looks cheap/gimmicky for enterprise

✗ $49.99/mo for a B2B SaaS
  → The .99 feels consumer, not business

✗ Using $X9 for all tiers
  → $29, $59, $99 lacks differentiation

✗ $199.97/mo
  → Overly specific, looks calculated

✗ Mixing patterns randomly
  → $29, $55, $100 creates confusion
```

### Threshold Psychology

| Threshold | Below | At/Above |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **$10** | Impulse buy | Consideration |
| **$50** | "Affordable" | "Investment" |
| **$100** | Individual decision | May need approval |
| **$500** | Manageable | Budget item |
| **$1,000** | Serious purchase | Committee/approval |

### Combining Decoys and Charm Pricing

```
Optimal Tier Structure:

├── Starter: $29/mo        (charm, entry)
│   → 5 users, basic features
│
├── Growth: $69/mo         (decoy position)
│   → 10 users, more features
│   → $6.90/user
│
└── Pro: $99/mo ★ BEST VALUE
    → 25 users, all features
    → $3.96/user
    → Below $100 threshold
```

### Price Perception by Format

| Format | Perception | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **$99** | Cheaper than | $99 |
| **$99.00** | More expensive feel | $99.00 |
| **$99/mo** | Clear commitment | $99/mo |
| **$99 per month** | More substantial | $99 per month |

### Testing Price Points

| Test Type | What to Measure |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **$X9 vs $X0** | Conversion rate difference |
| **With/without decoy** | Tier selection distribution |
| **Threshold crossing** | $99 vs $105 conversion |
| **Annual display** | $99/mo vs $1,188/yr perception |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Decoy that cannibalizes** — Accidentally making decoy too attractive
- **Obvious manipulation** — Decoys that insult intelligence
- **Charm pricing for enterprise** — $9,999/mo looks cheap, not serious
- **Inconsistent endings** — $29, $47, $85, $110 creates noise
- **Ignoring thresholds** — $105/mo when $99/mo is possible
- **Over-optimizing** — $97 vs $99 rarely matters, test bigger changes
- **Static pricing** — Never testing these psychological levers
