## Competitive Pricing Analysis

**Impact: MEDIUM**

Understanding competitive pricing informs your positioning, but copying competitors is a race to the bottom. Use competitive analysis to differentiate, not duplicate.

|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Entry price** | $29/mo | $49/mo | Free tier |
| **Target tier** | $99/mo | $149/mo | $79/mo |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | $299/mo | Custom |
| **Value metric** | Per seat | Per seat | Per project |

### Positioning Decision Matrix

             Low                     High
                  Relative Price
```

### Differentiation Over Price Matching

| Instead of... | Do This |
|---------------|---------|
| Matching lowest price | Differentiate on value |
| Matching highest price | Justify with premium features |
| Matching feature-for-feature | Find unmet needs |
| Copying their tiers | Design for your customers |
| Reacting to changes | Proactive value creation |

### Good Competitive Response

```
Scenario: Competitor drops price by 30%

✓ Good response:
"We're aware [Competitor] has reduced their prices. We've
decided to maintain our pricing because:

1. Our customers tell us our product saves them 10+ hours/week
2. Our 99.99% uptime SLA is unmatched
3. Our support response time is 2 hours vs their 24+

If price is your primary consideration, [Competitor] may be
a better fit. If value is, we're here."

→ Confident, differentiated, not reactive
```

### Bad Competitive Response

```
Scenario: Competitor drops price by 30%

✗ Bad response:
"PRICE MATCH SALE! For a limited time, we're matching
[Competitor]'s new lower prices!"

→ Looks desperate, damages brand, trains discounting

✗ Also bad:
"[Competitor]'s cheap pricing is because they cut corners
on security and support."

→ Negative selling rarely works, looks defensive
```

### Competitive Price Justification

| If You're More Expensive | Justify With |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| **20-50% higher** | Superior features, support, reliability |
| **50-100% higher** | Different segment (enterprise vs SMB) |
| **2x+ higher** | Different value prop entirely |

| If You're Cheaper | Position As |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **10-30% lower** | Better value, same capabilities |
| **30-50% lower** | Modern alternative, less bloat |
| **50%+ lower** | Disruptive, focused solution |

### Competitive Objection Handling

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "[Competitor] is cheaper" | Focus on value, TCO, outcomes |
| "[Competitor] has more features" | Focus on relevant features, simplicity |
| "[Competitor] is free" | Free has hidden costs (time, support, limits) |
| "[Competitor] is enterprise-proven" | Faster, more focused, better experience |
| "[Competitor] is market leader" | Innovation often comes from challengers |

### Good Objection Response

```
Prospect: "Competitor X is 40% cheaper."

Response: "You're right—Competitor X is less expensive upfront.
Here's what I'd encourage you to factor in:

1. Implementation: We're self-serve in 10 minutes. They require
   a 3-week implementation with professional services.

2. Support: We offer 24/7 support at all tiers. Their comparable
   support tier is actually more expensive than us.

3. ROI: Our customers report 5 hours/week saved. At $50/hour,
   that's $13,000/year per user.

When you factor in total cost and value, we're often the
better investment. Want to walk through the comparison?"
```

### Competitive Monitoring

| What to Monitor | Frequency | Tool |
|-----------------|-----------|------|
| **Pricing page changes** | Weekly | Visualping, archive.org |
| **Review site mentions** | Weekly | G2, Capterra alerts |
| **Social mentions** | Daily | Brand monitoring tools |
| **Job postings** | Monthly | LinkedIn, job boards |
| **Press/funding** | Ongoing | Google alerts, news |
| **Product changes** | Monthly | Product Hunt, changelogs |

### Competitive Intel Sources

| Source | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Lost deal analysis** | Why customers chose competitor |
| **Win analysis** | Why customers chose you |
| **Customer interviews** | Deep competitive perception |
| **Sales call recordings** | Objections and comparisons |
| **Support tickets** | Feature comparison requests |
| **Trial drop-offs** | What made them leave |

### Pricing Page Comparison Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Compare on your strengths | Compare on their strengths |
| Use factual differences | Make subjective claims |
| Link to third-party validation | Make unsubstantiated claims |
| Update regularly | Let it get stale |
| Be fair (acknowledge their strengths) | Be dismissive |

### Good Comparison Page

```
✓ "How we compare to [Competitor]"

| Feature | Us | [Competitor] |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| Starting price | $29/mo | $49/mo |
| Free trial | 14 days | 7 days |
| Uptime SLA | 99.99% | 99.5% |
| Support response | 2 hours | 24 hours |
| SSO included | Pro tier | Enterprise only |

"Both products solve [problem]. Here's how to decide:
• Choose us if: You value [X, Y, Z]
• Choose [Competitor] if: You need [A, B, C]"

→ Factual, fair, helps buyers decide
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Price matching** — Racing to the bottom
- **Negative selling** — Bashing competitors looks desperate
- **Ignoring competitors** — Not knowing your market
- **Copy-paste pricing** — Identical structure without strategy
- **Reacting to every move** — Chasing instead of leading
- **Outdated competitive info** — Using stale pricing/features
- **Single-competitor focus** — Ignoring the broader market
