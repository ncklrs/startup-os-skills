# Pricing Strategist

Expert pricing strategy and monetization guidance for SaaS and digital products — from psychology-driven pricing to enterprise negotiation tactics.

## Philosophy

Pricing is the most powerful lever in your business:

1. **Price is a signal** — It communicates value, market position, and customer fit
2. **Packaging is product** — How you bundle features shapes perceived value
3. **Simplicity wins** — Confused buyers don't buy
4. **Test everything** — Intuition about willingness-to-pay is usually wrong

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `psychology-*` — Behavioral economics, anchoring, framing, decoy pricing
- `packaging-*` — Tier structure, bundles, good/better/best frameworks
- `metrics-*` — Value metrics, usage-based, per-seat, flat-rate models
- `page-*` — Pricing page copy, design, and conversion optimization
- `enterprise-*` — Enterprise pricing, negotiation, custom deals
- `lifecycle-*` — Discounts, promotions, price increases, grandfathering

## Core Frameworks

### The Pricing Stack

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    VALUE CREATION                        │
│         What problem do you solve? How well?             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                   VALUE COMMUNICATION                    │

│                    VALUE CAPTURE                         │
│         How much value do you extract as price?          │

### Pricing Model Comparison

| Model | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| **Per-seat** | Collaboration tools | Predictable, scales with adoption | Discourages sharing |
| **Usage-based** | Infrastructure, API | Aligns with value, low entry | Unpredictable revenue |
| **Flat-rate** | Simple products | Easy to understand | Leaves money on table |
| **Tiered** | Most SaaS | Captures segments | Can be complex |
| **Hybrid** | Mature products | Flexible, optimized | Harder to communicate |

### Value Metric Selection

Your value metric should be:

| Criteria | Question | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Easy to understand** | Can you explain it in 5 words? | "Pay per user per month" |
| **Aligned with value** | Does customer pay more as they get more value? | More emails sent = more conversions |
| **Predictable** | Can customer forecast their bill? | Seat count is predictable |
| **Scalable** | Does it grow with the customer? | API calls scale with usage |

### The Willingness-to-Pay Curve

```
High WTP │    ●●●  Enterprise
         │   ●●●●●
         │  ●●●●●●●  Pro
         │ ●●●●●●●●●
         │●●●●●●●●●●●  Starter
Low WTP  │●●●●●●●●●●●●●
         └────────────────────
          Few          Many
               Customers
```

Capture value at each segment with differentiated packaging.

## Pricing Psychology Principles

| Principle | How It Works | Application |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Anchoring** | First price sets expectations | Show enterprise price first |
| **Decoy effect** | Third option makes one look better | Middle tier becomes attractive |
| **Charm pricing** | 9-ending feels cheaper | $99 vs $100 |
| **Price partitioning** | Split price seems smaller | $50/mo + $20 support |
| **Round numbers** | Feel more premium | $1,000 for enterprise |

## Packaging Framework

### Good/Better/Best Structure

| Tier | Target | Feature Strategy | Pricing |
|------|--------|------------------|---------|
| **Good (Starter)** | Entry-level, price-sensitive | Core features, limited usage | Low anchor |
| **Better (Pro)** | Growth, main target | Full features, higher limits | Optimal margin |
| **Best (Enterprise)** | High-value, complex needs | Unlimited, premium support | Value-based |

### Feature Fencing Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Usage limits** | Cap quantity/volume | 1,000 vs 10,000 emails |
| **Feature gates** | Reserve features for higher tiers | SSO in Enterprise |
| **Support tiers** | Differentiate service level | Email vs dedicated CSM |
| **SLA guarantees** | Higher uptime commitments | 99.9% vs 99.99% |
| **Integration access** | Limit connection types | Basic vs premium integrations |

## Annual vs Monthly Framework

| Factor | Monthly | Annual |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Discount** | Baseline | 15-20% off (2 months free) |
| **Cash flow** | Spread out | Upfront capital |
| **Churn** | Higher (monthly exit) | Lower (commitment) |
| **Target** | Skeptics, small biz | Confident, enterprise |
| **Positioning** | "Flexibility" | "Best value" |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Race to bottom** — Competing on price alone destroys margins
- **Complexity overload** — 6+ tiers confuse buyers
- **Feature stuffing** — More features ≠ higher perceived value
- **Discount addiction** — Training customers to wait for sales
- **One-size pricing** — Leaving money on table from high-value customers
- **Hidden fees** — Surprise charges destroy trust
- **Anchoring backwards** — Showing cheapest option first
- **Ignoring segments** — Same price for SMB and enterprise
