# Partnership Marketer

Expert partnership marketing guidance for building scalable partner ecosystems, co-marketing campaigns, and channel programs — from partner selection to revenue attribution.

## Philosophy

Great partnership marketing creates multiplier effects:

1. **Strategic alignment** — Partners succeed when you succeed, and vice versa
2. **Mutual value creation** — Every partnership should benefit both parties measurably
3. **Scalable enablement** — Partners should be able to sell/integrate without hand-holding
4. **Compounding returns** — Strong partnerships generate referrals and expand networks

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `strategy-*` — Partner selection, program design, and strategic planning
- `comarketing-*` — Joint campaigns, content collaboration, and co-branding
- `marketplace-*` — Integration marketplace positioning and optimization
- `program-*` — Partner tiers, benefits, and program structure
- `enablement-*` — Partner training, content, and sales tools
- `revenue-*` — Revenue sharing, attribution, and commission structures

## Core Frameworks

### Partner Program Tiers

| Tier | Criteria | Typical Benefits |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Registered** | Signed agreement | Logo use, basic portal access |
| **Silver** | $10K revenue or 5 referrals | Co-marketing funds, training |
| **Gold** | $50K revenue or 20 referrals | Dedicated PM, joint campaigns |
| **Platinum** | $200K+ revenue | Custom pricing, executive sponsor |

### Co-Marketing Investment Formula

```
Co-Marketing Budget = Partner Tier Budget × Pipeline Potential × Strategic Value Score
```

| Factor | Multiplier Range |
|--------|------------------|
| Partner Tier Budget | Base allocation per tier |
| Pipeline Potential | 0.5x - 2x based on lead quality |
| Strategic Value Score | 0.8x - 1.5x based on brand alignment |

## Partnership Types at a Glance

| Type | Goal | Key Metric | Time to Value |
|------|------|------------|---------------|
| Technology/Integration | Expand functionality | Active integrations | 3-6 months |
| Affiliate | Lead generation | Referred revenue | 1-3 months |
| Reseller/Channel | Sales extension | Partner-sourced ARR | 6-12 months |
| Strategic Alliance | Market expansion | Co-sold deals | 6-18 months |
| OEM/White-label | Revenue diversification | Embedded revenue | 12-24 months |

## Key Partnership Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Partner-Sourced Revenue** | Revenue from partner leads | 20-30% of total |
| **Partner-Influenced Revenue** | Partner involved in deal | 40-50% of total |
| **Partner Activation Rate** | Active partners / Total partners | 60%+ |
| **Partner NPS** | Partner satisfaction score | 50+ |
| **Revenue per Partner** | Total partner revenue / Active partners | Varies by tier |
| **Time to First Deal** | Days from signup to first closed deal | <90 days |

## Partner Enablement Stack

| Asset | Purpose | Priority |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Partner Portal | Self-service hub | CRITICAL |
| Sales Playbook | How to sell with/through you | CRITICAL |
| Integration Docs | Technical enablement | HIGH |
| Co-brandable Content | Marketing materials | HIGH |
| Demo Environment | Show capabilities | MEDIUM |
| Certification Program | Ensure quality | MEDIUM |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Quantity over quality** — 100 inactive partners < 10 engaged ones
- **One-sided value** — Partners who only take, never give (and vice versa)
- **No attribution** — Can't prove partner value, can't justify investment
- **Ignoring partner success** — Your success tied to theirs
- **Overcomplicating tiers** — If partners can't explain it, it won't work
- **Set and forget** — Partnerships need ongoing nurturing
- **MDF without accountability** — Marketing funds with no ROI tracking
- **Competing with partners** — Selling direct into partner accounts
