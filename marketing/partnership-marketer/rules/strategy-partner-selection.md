## Partner Selection Strategy

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Partner selection is the foundation of a successful partnership program. The wrong partners drain resources while the right ones become force multipliers.

### Partner Evaluation Framework

| Criteria | Weight | Questions to Ask |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Strategic Fit** | 25% | Do they serve our ICP? Do our products complement? |
| **Market Position** | 20% | Are they credible? What's their reach? |
| **Technical Capability** | 20% | Can they integrate/implement effectively? |
| **Go-to-Market Alignment** | 20% | Do they have sales capacity? Marketing maturity? |
| **Cultural Fit** | 15% | Do they share our values? Are they partner-friendly? |

### Partner Qualification Scorecard

| Dimension | Score 1-5 | Indicators |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Customer Overlap** | | Shared ICP, complementary segments |
| **Product Synergy** | | Integration value, workflow fit |
| **Sales Capacity** | | Dedicated partner resources, quota |
| **Marketing Capability** | | Content team, event presence, budget |
| **Technical Depth** | | Engineering resources, API expertise |
| **Brand Alignment** | | Reputation, market perception |
| **Commitment Level** | | Executive sponsor, dedicated team |

**Scoring Guide:**
- 35+: Platinum potential — prioritize heavily
- 25-34: Gold potential — invest moderately
- 15-24: Silver potential — standard engagement
- <15: Not ready — revisit in 6 months

### Partner Archetype Matrix

| Archetype | Profile | Best Engagement |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Platform Giants** | AWS, Salesforce, Microsoft | Marketplace listing, technical integration |
| **Ecosystem Leaders** | Category leaders in adjacent space | Co-selling, joint solutions |
| **Rising Stars** | Fast-growing companies, shared trajectory | Co-marketing, mutual promotion |
| **Specialists** | Niche expertise, consultancies | Implementation, services partnership |
| **Affiliates** | Content creators, influencers | Referral, commission-based |

### Red Flags in Partner Selection

| Red Flag | Why It Matters | Alternative |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **No dedicated partner team** | Partnership will be deprioritized | Wait until they build capacity |
| **Competitive overlap** | Conflict of interest | Define clear swim lanes |
| **Poor customer reviews** | Association risk | Protect your brand |
| **Financial instability** | Partnership may not last | Monitor or delay |
| **Misaligned incentives** | Goals will diverge | Restructure deal terms |
| **One-way interest** | You'll do all the work | Find mutual value |

### Good Partner Selection

```
✓ Define ideal partner profile (IPP) before prospecting
  → "SaaS companies serving mid-market HR teams with
     active sales team and 500+ customers"

✓ Score partners objectively before engaging
  → Salesforce scored 42/50 on our partner scorecard
  → Strong in customer overlap, marketing capability
  → Gap in dedicated partner resources (improving)

✓ Start with pilot before full commitment
  → 90-day co-marketing pilot with defined success metrics
  → If 10+ qualified leads, proceed to full partnership

✓ Verify commitment at multiple levels
  → Executive sponsor confirmed
  → Partner manager assigned
  → Marketing budget allocated
  → Sales team briefed
```

### Bad Partner Selection

```
✗ Pursuing big logos regardless of fit
  → Signed partnership with Fortune 500, but their
     customers don't match our ICP
  → 0 leads after 6 months, significant resource investment

✗ Relying on relationship alone
  → "We know their CEO, so it'll work out"
  → No formal agreement, no resources, no results

✗ Ignoring competitive dynamics
  → Partner's new product competes directly with us
  → Channel conflict destroys relationship

✗ No qualification process
  → Signed any partner who expressed interest
  → 200 partners, 15 active, massive support burden

✗ Overcommitting to unproven partners
  → Full integration and co-marketing launch
  → Partner pivoted strategy, integration deprecated
```

### Partner Outreach Prioritization

| Priority | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **P0** | Score 35+, active interest, shared customer | Immediate outreach, executive involvement |
| **P1** | Score 25-34, strategic market | Structured BD approach, pilot proposal |
| **P2** | Score 15-24, growth potential | Nurture, wait for readiness signals |
| **P3** | Score <15 | Monitor, check back quarterly |

### Partnership Agreement Essentials

| Element | Purpose | Example Terms |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Scope** | Define boundaries | "Joint marketing in North America for HR segment" |
| **Commitment** | Set expectations | "Minimum 2 co-marketing campaigns per quarter" |
| **Exclusivity** | Protect investment | "Non-exclusive, category-aware" |
| **Term** | Enable evaluation | "12 months with 90-day review checkpoints" |
| **Exit** | Plan for change | "90-day notice, data handling defined" |

### Partner Discovery Channels

| Channel | Effectiveness | Best For |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Customer requests** | Very High | Integration partners |
| **Competitor partnerships** | High | Strategic validation |
| **Industry events** | High | Ecosystem mapping |
| **Inbound interest** | Medium-High | Motivated partners |
| **Partner directories** | Medium | Discovery at scale |
| **Cold outreach** | Low-Medium | Targeted gaps |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Logo hunting** — Big names without strategic fit waste resources
- **Quantity metrics** — "100 partners" means nothing if they're inactive
- **Rushing to agreement** — Pilot first, commit after validation
- **Ignoring partner economics** — If they can't make money, they won't engage
- **Single-threaded relationships** — When your contact leaves, partnership dies
- **No qualification criteria** — Subjective decisions lead to inconsistent results
