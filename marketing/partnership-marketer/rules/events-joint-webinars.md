### Anti-Patterns

- **One-sided promotion** — Partner doesn't pull their weight
- **Sales pitch disguised** — Attendees feel tricked, don't convert
- **No dry run** — Technical issues during live event
- **Ignoring time zones** — Single time excludes half your audience
- **No follow-up plan** — Leads go cold
- **Partner not on stage** — Defeats the purpose of "joint"
- **Overloaded agenda** — 2-hour webinar loses everyone
- **No metrics** — Can't prove ROI, can't justify future events
- **Last-minute planning** — 2-week notice isn't enough for quality attendance
