```

### Category Selection Strategy

| Strategy | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Primary category match** | Strong fit exists | CRM Tools, Analytics |
| **Adjacent category** | Primary is oversaturated | Data Tools vs. CRM |
| **Emerging category** | New market opportunity | AI Tools, Automation |
| **Multiple categories** | Platform allows | Primary + Secondary |

### Pricing Display Options

| Model | Display | Best For |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Free** | "Free" badge prominent | Adoption-focused |
| **Freemium** | "Free plan available" | Land-and-expand |
| **Free trial** | "14-day free trial" | Conversion-focused |
| **Contact sales** | "Contact for pricing" | Enterprise only |
| **Usage-based** | "Starting at $X/mo" | Transparent, scalable |

### Marketplace SEO Factors

| Factor | Weight | Optimization |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Keywords in name** | High | Include category terms |
| **Keywords in description** | High | Natural keyword usage |
| **Reviews (quantity)** | Very High | Active review generation |
| **Reviews (recency)** | High | Ongoing review campaigns |
| **Installs/Usage** | Very High | Drive adoption |
| **Rating** | Very High | Maintain 4.5+ stars |
| **Completeness** | Medium | Fill all available fields |

| **Specialist** | Own your niche, go deep |
| **New entrant** | Ease of use, modern approach, specific win |

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Good | Great | Action if Below |

| **Install rate** | 5% | 15% | Improve listing quality |
| **Activation rate** | 40% | 70% | Improve onboarding |
| **Rating** | 4.0 | 4.7+ | Address feedback, support |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Set and forget** — Listings need regular updates and optimization
- **Generic descriptions** — Same copy as your website doesn't convert
- **Ignoring reviews** — Negative reviews without response hurt ranking
- **Wrong category** — Buried in wrong category kills discovery
- **No screenshots** — Visual-first platforms penalize text-only
- **Outdated information** — Old pricing, deprecated features confuse users
- **Keyword stuffing** — Unnatural language hurts readability and trust
- **No differentiation** — Same as competitors, no reason to choose you
