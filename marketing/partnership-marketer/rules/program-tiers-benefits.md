## Partner Program Tiers and Benefits

**Impact: HIGH**

Well-designed tiers motivate partners to invest more while ensuring you allocate resources efficiently. Poor tier design leads to either over-investment in low performers or under-investment in top partners.

### Tier Design Principles

| Principle | Why It Matters | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Clear qualification** | Partners know what to aim for | Objective metrics, not subjective |
| **Meaningful differentiation** | Worth the effort to level up | Each tier has exclusive benefits |
| **Achievable progression** | Partners stay motivated | Realistic criteria for each jump |
| **Sustainable economics** | Program remains profitable | Benefits scale with partner value |

### Standard Tier Structure

| Tier | Revenue Threshold | Certification | Benefits Level |
|------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Registered** | $0 (signed agreement) | None required | Basic |
| **Silver** | $25K ARR or 5 referrals | 1 certified | Standard |
| **Gold** | $100K ARR or 20 referrals | 2 certified | Enhanced |
| **Platinum** | $500K+ ARR or 50 referrals | 5 certified | Premium |

### Benefits Matrix

| Benefit | Registered | Silver | Gold | Platinum |
|---------|------------|--------|------|----------|
| **Partner Portal Access** | Basic | Full | Full | Full |
| **Logo Usage Rights** | None | Standard | Premium | Custom |
| **Partner Directory Listing** | No | Basic | Featured | Spotlight |
| **Deal Registration** | No | Yes | Yes | Priority |
| **Commission/Margin** | 10% | 15% | 20% | 25%+ |
| **Co-Marketing Funds (MDF)** | $0 | $2K/yr | $10K/yr | $50K+/yr |
| **Partner Manager** | Pooled | Pooled | Dedicated | Senior PM |
| **Training Access** | Self-serve | Live sessions | Custom | On-site |
| **Sales Support** | None | Email | Dedicated SE | Named SE |
| **Lead Sharing** | No | Limited | Full | Priority |
| **Executive Access** | No | No | Quarterly | Monthly |
| **Early Access** | No | No | Beta | Alpha |
| **Event Participation** | No | Attend | Sponsor | Keynote |
| **Support SLA** | Standard | 24hr | 4hr | 1hr |

### Qualification Criteria Options

| Metric Type | Examples | Best For |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Revenue-based** | ARR sourced, influenced, sold | High-value programs |
| **Activity-based** | Referrals submitted, deals registered | Affiliate programs |
| **Certification-based** | People certified, exams passed | Technical programs |
| **Engagement-based** | Training completed, content downloaded | New programs |
| **Hybrid** | Revenue + certification + activity | Mature programs |

### Good Tier Design

```
SILVER TIER — Growth Partners
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Qualification:
• $25K partner-sourced ARR in trailing 12 months, OR
• 5 qualified referrals that convert to opportunities

Benefits:
• 15% commission on partner-sourced deals
• $2,000 annual co-marketing fund
• Partner directory listing (basic)
• 2 seats for live partner training (quarterly)
• Deal registration protection (30 days)
• Access to co-branded content library
• Pooled partner manager support

Progression to Gold:
• Increase ARR to $100K, OR
• 20 qualified referrals
• Achieve 2 partner certifications


Why This Works:
✓ Clear, measurable criteria
✓ Multiple paths to qualify (revenue OR referrals)
✓ Benefits justify the effort
✓ Clear progression path shown
```

### Bad Tier Design

```
PARTNER LEVELS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Level 1: Starter
• Signed partnership agreement

Level 2: Growing
• "Demonstrated commitment to the partnership"

Level 3: Strategic
• "Significant business impact"

Benefits:
• All partners get logo use
• All partners can attend events
• Commission varies by deal

Problems:
✗ Subjective qualification ("demonstrated commitment"?)
✗ No measurable criteria
✗ Benefits don't differentiate tiers
✗ No clear progression path
✗ Commission not tied to tier
✗ No incentive to level up
```

### Tier Economics Model

| Tier | Avg Revenue | Your Margin | Partner Cost | ROI |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| **Registered** | $5K | 70% | $500 (portal) | 7x |
| **Silver** | $50K | 65% | $5K (MDF, support) | 6.5x |
| **Gold** | $200K | 60% | $30K (PM, MDF, SE) | 4x |
| **Platinum** | $1M+ | 55% | $150K (team, events) | 3.7x |

### Tier Progression Tactics

| Tactic | Impact | Implementation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Progress notifications** | High | "You're 70% to Gold!" |
| **Tier benefits preview** | High | Show what they'll unlock |
| **Qualification calculator** | Medium | Self-service tool |
| **Proactive PM outreach** | High | "2 more deals to Gold" |
| **Accelerator programs** | High | Fast-track for high-potential |

### Tier Maintenance Requirements

| Tier | Review Period | Grace Period | Downgrade Policy |
|------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Silver** | Annual | 1 quarter | Drop to Registered |
| **Gold** | Annual | 2 quarters | Drop to Silver |
| **Platinum** | Annual | 3 quarters | Drop to Gold |

### Special Tier Considerations

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **Strategic partners** | Automatic Platinum regardless of revenue |
| **New partners with potential** | 6-month provisional tier |
| **Declining partners** | Soft landing with support plan |
| **Seasonal businesses** | Rolling 12-month qualification |
| **Multi-product partners** | Aggregate across products |

### Program Communication

| Audience | Frequency | Content |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **All partners** | Monthly | Newsletter, updates |
| **By tier** | Monthly | Tier-specific opportunities |
| **At-risk** | Weekly | Re-engagement, support |
| **High performers** | Weekly | Priority opportunities |

### Benefit Utilization Tracking

| Benefit | Target Utilization | If Under-Utilized |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **MDF** | 80%+ | Simplify process, educate |
| **Training** | 60%+ | Improve content, scheduling |
| **Deal registration** | 70%+ | Reduce friction, train |
| **Content library** | 40%+ | Better curation, promotion |
| **Sales support** | 50%+ | Awareness campaign |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Too many tiers** — 3-4 tiers max; more creates confusion
- **Unclear criteria** — "Strategic importance" isn't measurable
- **Benefits not differentiated** — Each tier needs exclusive value
- **Impossible progression** — Gap between tiers too large
- **No maintenance requirement** — Partners coast on historical performance
- **One-size-fits-all** — Different partner types need different tracks
- **Benefits without accountability** — MDF with no ROI tracking
- **Tier-only thinking** — Some top partners don't fit tier models
