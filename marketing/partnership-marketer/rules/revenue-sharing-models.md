## Revenue Sharing and Commission Models

**Impact: HIGH**

Revenue sharing aligns partner incentives with your success. Get the model right and partners prioritize you. Get it wrong and you either overpay or under-motivate.

### Revenue Model Types

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Referral fee** | One-time payment per lead/sale | Low-touch, transactional |
| **Commission** | Percentage of deal value | Sales partnerships |
| **Revenue share** | Ongoing percentage of revenue | Long-term partnerships |
| **Margin/Discount** | Partner buys at discount, sells at list | Resellers |
| **MDF** | Marketing funds for activities | Co-marketing programs |
| **Hybrid** | Combination of above | Complex partnerships |

### Commission Structure Benchmarks

| Partnership Type | Typical Commission | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Referral** | 10-20% of first year | One-time, low support |
| **Reseller** | 20-40% margin | Ongoing, partner owns relationship |
| **Affiliate** | 20-30% recurring | Ongoing, you own relationship |
| **SI/Consulting** | 10-15% of services | Implementation revenue |
| **Technology** | 0-10% | Often reciprocal or strategic |
| **OEM/White-label** | 40-60% discount | Volume-based |

### Deal Attribution Models

| Model | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
|-------|--------------|------|------|
| **First touch** | Credit to initial referrer | Simple, rewards sourcing | Ignores influence |
| **Last touch** | Credit to final touch | Simple, rewards closing | Ignores discovery |
| **Linear** | Equal credit across touches | Fair distribution | Dilutes impact |
| **Time decay** | More credit to recent touches | Rewards closers | Complex |
| **Custom** | Rules-based assignment | Fits your model | Requires maintenance |

### Partner Attribution Framework

```
ATTRIBUTION RULES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ No prior engagement from direct sales

Commission: 100% of partner rate


PARTNER-INFLUENCED (Partial Commission):

```

### Good Revenue Sharing Model

```
RESELLER PARTNER PROGRAM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Margin Structure:
• Standard margin: 25% off list price
• Silver partners: 30% margin
• Gold partners: 35% margin
• Platinum partners: 40% margin + volume rebates

Deal Registration:
• Submit opportunity before quote
• 30-day protection period

✓ Volume rebates reward scale
```

### Bad Revenue Sharing Model

```
PARTNER COMPENSATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Commission: "Competitive rates"

Attribution: "Determined on case-by-case basis"

Payment: "Quarterly, subject to approval"

Terms: "May change at any time"

Problems:
✗ No specific rates (partners can't plan)
✗ Subjective attribution (leads to disputes)
✗ Vague payment terms (cash flow uncertainty)
✗ No stability (partners won't invest)
✗ No tier incentive (no reason to grow)
```

### MDF (Marketing Development Funds)

| MDF Approach | Description | Control Level |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposal-based** | Partner submits plan for approval | High |
| **Accrual** | Funds accrue based on sales | Medium |
| **Discretionary** | Allocated by partner manager | High |
| **Pre-approved activities** | Menu of approved uses | Medium |
| **Co-op** | Match partner marketing spend | Medium |

### MDF Best Practices

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Clear eligibility** | "Silver+ partners, minimum $25K ARR" |
| **Defined uses** | "Events, content, advertising, not swag" |
| **ROI requirements** | "Must report leads/pipeline generated" |
| **Approval process** | "<$5K: PM approves. >$5K: Director approval" |
| **Reimbursement timeline** | "Net 15 from receipt submission" |
| **Use-it-or-lose-it** | "Funds expire end of fiscal year" |

### MDF Allocation by Tier

| Tier | Annual MDF | Quarterly Cap | Approval |
|------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Silver** | $5,000 | $2,000 | Partner Manager |
| **Gold** | $25,000 | $10,000 | PM + Director |
| **Platinum** | $100,000+ | $35,000 | VP approval |

- **Delayed payments** — Cash flow matters to partners
- **Changing terms retroactively** — Partners lose trust
- **Over-complicated tiers** — If partners can't calculate, they won't sell
- **No clawback protection** — Bad referrals hurt your business
- **MDF without accountability** — Money spent with no ROI tracking
- **Commission caps** — Top partners stop selling once capped
- **Ignoring renewal commissions** — Partners don't care about retention
- **Manual processes** — Errors and delays at scale
