## Affiliate Program Design

**Impact: HIGH**

Affiliate programs scale word-of-mouth through financial incentives. Done right, they create an army of advocates. Done wrong, they attract low-quality traffic and brand risk.

### Affiliate vs. Referral vs. Partner

| Program Type | Relationship | Motivation | Commission Level |
|--------------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Referral** | Existing customer | Reciprocity, rewards | Low (1-10%) |
| **Affiliate** | Content creator, marketer | Revenue | Medium (10-30%) |
| **Partner** | Business relationship | Strategic | High (20-40%) |

### Commission Structure Models

| Model | How It Works | Best For |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Flat fee** | $X per signup/sale | Low ACV products |
| **Percentage** | X% of first sale | Most SaaS |
| **Recurring** | X% for customer lifetime | Subscription products |
| **Tiered** | Higher % at volume | Motivating top performers |
| **Hybrid** | Flat + percentage | Balancing CAC |

### Commission Benchmarks by Industry

| Industry | Typical Commission | Cookie Duration |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **SaaS** | 20-30% recurring or 100% first month | 30-90 days |
| **E-commerce** | 5-15% one-time | 30 days |
| **Financial** | $50-500 per signup | 30-60 days |
| **Education** | 20-50% per course | 30 days |
| **Hosting** | $50-200 or 20-30% | 60-90 days |

### Program Economics

```
Monthly Affiliate Revenue Target: $50,000

Model: 25% recurring commission
Average Customer Value: $100/month
Commission per Customer: $25/month

Required Affiliate-Sourced Customers:
$50,000 ÷ $100 = 500 customers

Commission Payout:
500 × $25 = $12,500/month (25% of revenue)

Effective CAC via Affiliate:
~$25/month × 12 months = $300 LTV contribution
If churn is 5%/month, break-even in 4 months
```

### Tiered Commission Structure

| Tier | Monthly Referrals | Commission |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| **Starter** | 1-5 | 20% |
| **Pro** | 6-20 | 25% |
| **Elite** | 21-50 | 30% |
| **Super** | 51+ | 35% + bonus |

### Affiliate Recruitment Strategy

| Channel | Quality | Volume | Effort |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Existing customers** | Very High | Low | Low |
| **Industry influencers** | High | Low | High |
| **Content creators** | High | Medium | Medium |
| **Affiliate networks** | Medium | High | Low |
| **Competitor affiliates** | High | Medium | Medium |
| **SEO bloggers** | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **Course creators** | High | Low | Medium |
