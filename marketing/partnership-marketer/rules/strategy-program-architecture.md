**Impact: CRITICAL**

Program architecture determines scalability. A well-designed program grows efficiently; a poorly designed one breaks under its own weight.

### Bad Program Architecture

```
PARTNER PROGRAM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Partner Types:
• Partners (anyone who signs up)

Tiers:
• Standard (everyone)
• Premium (decided by us)

Economics:

Metrics:
• Number of partners

Problems:
✗ No clear partner types or value prop
✗ Subjective tier assignment
✗ Vague economics
✗ No systems or process
✗ Vanity metrics only
✗ No scalable operations
```

### Program Launch Checklist

```

### Program Scalability Factors

|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Onboarding** | High-touch, manual | Self-service, automated |
| **Training** | Live sessions | On-demand + certification |
| **Support** | Direct access | Tiered, portal-first |
| **Marketing** | Custom per partner | Templated + MDF |
| **Reporting** | Spreadsheets | PRM dashboards |
| **Deal Registration** | Email-based | System-automated |

### Technology Stack

| Function | Tools | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **PRM** | Impartner, Allbound, Channeltivity | Critical |
| **CRM Integration** | Salesforce, HubSpot | Critical |
| **Learning** | Skilljar, Docebo, Northpass | High |
| **Marketing** | Co-branded asset platform | High |
| **Attribution** | Crossbeam, Reveal | High |
| **Communication** | Partner Slack, Community | Medium |
| **Analytics** | BI tools, custom dashboards | Medium |

### Program Maturity Assessment

| Dimension | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Strategy** | Ad hoc | Documented | Integrated | Optimized |
| **Partner types** | Single | 2-3 defined | Specialized tracks | Dynamic |
| **Tiers** | None | Basic | Differentiated | Predictive |
| **Economics** | Manual | Standardized | Automated | Optimized |
| **Enablement** | Minimal | Basic curriculum | Certification | Personalized |
| **Operations** | Manual | Tooling | Integrated | Automated |
| **Metrics** | Lagging only | Leading + lagging | Predictive | Real-time |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Build before validate** — Launch program before proving partner value
- **One-size-fits-all** — Same program for different partner types
- **No dedicated resources** — Partnerships as side job fails
- **Over-engineered early** — Complex tiers for 10 partners
- **Under-engineered late** — Manual processes at 500 partners
- **No executive sponsor** — Program lacks strategic priority
- **Copying competitors** — Their program fits their model, not yours
- **Revenue-only focus** — Ignoring strategic and ecosystem value
- **No iteration** — Program stays static as market changes
