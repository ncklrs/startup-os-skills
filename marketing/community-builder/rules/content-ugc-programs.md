## User-Generated Content Programs

**Impact: HIGH**

User-generated content (UGC) scales community value exponentially. When members create content, they deepen their commitment and attract new members through authentic voices. Communities with strong UGC see 3-5x more organic growth.

### Bad UGC Programs

```
"Share your content!"

✗ No specific ask
  → Members don't know what to share

✗ No incentive or recognition
  → Why should they bother?

✗ No distribution promise
  → Content dies in obscurity

✗ Complex submission process
  → Friction kills participation

✗ No quality bar
  → Garbage in, garbage out

✗ No templates or guidance
  → Results vary wildly
```

### UGC Incentive Models

| **Recognition** | Early community | Free, authentic | Limited reach |
| **Badges/Status** | Gamified community | Visible, scalable | Can feel hollow |
| **Swag** | Enthusiast community | Tangible, brandable | Expensive at scale |
| **Cash/Gift cards** | Professional content | Motivating | Attracts mercenaries |
| **Access** | Exclusive community | High value, low cost | Limited scale |
| **Exposure** | Aspiring thought leaders | Win-win | Requires real audience |

- **Unpaid labor framing** — "Contribute for exposure" to professionals
- **No feedback loop** — Submit and never hear back
- **Low-quality flood** — Accept everything, quality suffers
- **Gatekeeping** — Standards so high no one can contribute
- **One-time ask** — No ongoing program or system
- **Inconsistent amplification** — Some content promoted, most ignored
- **No attribution** — Using UGC without crediting creator
- **Complex processes** — Friction kills contribution motivation
