## Moderation and Governance

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Moderation is invisible when done well and catastrophic when done poorly. One unchecked bad actor can poison a community; one heavy-handed moderation decision can spark exodus. Clear governance structures and consistent enforcement create the safety that allows authentic community to flourish.

### Bad Code of Conduct

```
✗ Too long and legalistic
  → No one reads 10 pages of rules

✗ Too vague
  → "Be nice" doesn't define boundaries

✗ No enforcement clarity
  → People don't know consequences

✗ No reporting mechanism
  → Victims have nowhere to turn

✗ Copy-pasted template
  → Doesn't reflect community values
```

### Community Guidelines vs Code of Conduct

| Code of Conduct | Community Guidelines |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Values and ethics | Practical participation rules |
| Safety and inclusion | Quality and relevance |
| Rarely changes | Evolves with community |
| Universal principles | Platform-specific |
| "Don't be harmful" | "Do be helpful" |

### Channel/Space Rules

```
#general
- All community topics welcome
- Keep it friendly and constructive
- Use threads for longer discussions

#help
- Ask specific, searchable questions
- Show what you've tried
- Mark solved questions as resolved
- No "just Google it" responses

#show-and-tell

```

### Moderation Team Structure

| Role | Responsibilities | Number |
|------|------------------|--------|
| **Community Lead** | Strategy, escalations, team management | 1 |
| **Moderator** | Day-to-day moderation, enforcement | 1 per 2-3k active |
| **Champion/Volunteer Mod** | Peer support, light moderation | 1 per 500-1k active |
| **Bot** | Automated spam detection, warnings | As needed |

### Moderator Selection

```
Ideal moderator traits:
✓ Respected community member
✓ Calm under pressure
✓ Fair and consistent
✓ Good judgment
✓ Available regularly
✓ Aligned with community values
✓ Can keep confidentiality

Red flags:
✗ Power-seeking
✗ History of conflict
✗ Biased toward certain members
✗ Inconsistent activity
✗ Poor communication
```

### Moderation Actions

| Violation Level | Example | Action |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| **Minor** | Off-topic post, mild rudeness | Redirect, gentle reminder |
| **Moderate** | Repeated rule breaks, heated argument | Warning, content removal |
| **Serious** | Harassment, discrimination | Temp ban (1-30 days) |
| **Severe** | Threats, illegal content, doxxing | Immediate permanent ban |

### The Escalation Ladder

```
Level 1: Peer feedback
- Community members remind each other
- "Hey, let's keep this constructive"

Level 2: Soft moderation
- Moderator redirects conversation
- Moves content to appropriate channel
- Public but gentle correction

Level 3: Private warning
- DM to member
- Explain the issue
- Set expectations

Level 4: Public warning
- Visible intervention
- Clear statement of violation
- Last chance before action

Level 5: Temporary timeout
- Mute or suspend (1-30 days)
- Explain reason and duration
- Path to return

Level 6: Permanent removal
- Ban from community
- Document reason
- Final decision
```

### Good Moderation Example

```
Situation: Member posts aggressive reply to someone's question

Bad response:
"Don't be rude. This is your warning."
→ Public shaming, defensive reaction

Good response:
[Private DM]
"Hey [Name], I noticed your reply to [Member]'s question
came across pretty harsh. I know you're knowledgeable
and probably frustrated with basic questions, but we want
everyone to feel comfortable asking here.

Could you help us keep the tone welcoming? Maybe point them
to resources instead of criticizing the question.

Thanks for being part of the community - we value your expertise."

→ Private, assumes good intent, explains impact, requests behavior
```

### Conflict Resolution

```
Step 1: Cool down
- Pause the public conversation
- "Let's take a break from this thread"

Step 2: Understand
- DM both parties separately
- Get each perspective
- Identify the actual issue

Step 3: Mediate (if appropriate)
- Facilitate direct conversation
- Focus on resolution, not blame
- Find common ground

Step 4: Resolve
- Agree on path forward
- Document if needed
- Follow up to ensure resolved

Step 5: Learn
- What could prevent this next time?
- Do guidelines need updating?
- Were there warning signs missed?
```

### Handling Difficult Situations

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Heated argument** | Pause thread, DM participants, mediate |
| **Consistent negativity** | Private conversation about impact |
| **Spam/promotion** | Remove, warn, ban if repeated |
| **Misinformation** | Correct publicly with sources |
| **Harassment** | Remove content, ban, support victim |
| **Doxxing** | Immediate removal and ban |
| **Legal threats** | Escalate to company legal |
| **Mental health crisis** | Direct to resources, involve appropriate help |

### Transparency in Moderation

```
What to share publicly:
✓ Community guidelines and CoC
✓ General enforcement philosophy
✓ Changes to rules (with explanation)
✓ Aggregate moderation stats (optional)

What to keep private:
✗ Specific violation details
✗ Individual warning history
✗ Internal moderator discussions
✗ Reporter identities
```

### Documentation

```
Moderation Log Entry:
- Date/time
- Member involved
- Violation type
- Evidence (screenshots, links)
- Action taken
- Moderator handling
- Notes for future reference

Why document:
✓ Consistency across moderators
✓ Track patterns
✓ Defend decisions if challenged
✓ Training for new moderators
```

### Automated Moderation

| Tool Type | Use Case | Caution |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Spam filter** | Block obvious spam | May catch legitimate posts |
| **Profanity filter** | Flag or remove slurs | Context matters |
| **Link scanner** | Check for malicious links | May block legitimate links |
| **New user limits** | Restrict new accounts | Don't over-restrict |
| **Slow mode** | Cool heated conversations | Don't leave on forever |

### Moderation Burnout Prevention

```
For moderators:
✓ Set boundaries (don't be on-call 24/7)
✓ Share the load (rotation, coverage)
✓ Private mod channel to vent/debrief
✓ Recognition for the invisible work
✓ Permission to step back when needed

For community managers:
✓ Don't rely on one hero moderator
✓ Compensate volunteer mods (swag, access, recognition)
✓ Regular check-ins with mod team
✓ Clear escalation paths
✓ Handle the hardest stuff yourself
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **No rules** — "We're chill" until something goes wrong
- **Too many rules** — Over-regulation kills authentic conversation
- **Inconsistent enforcement** — Favorites get passes, undermines trust
- **Public shaming** — Calling out violations publicly creates defensiveness
- **Slow response** — Drama festers when mods aren't around
- **No escalation path** — Mods stuck with impossible decisions
- **Power-tripping mods** — Moderators on ego trips drive members away
- **Ignoring context** — Rules without judgment miss nuance
- **No appeals** — One mod's bad call is permanent
- **Volunteer mod exploitation** — Expecting free labor indefinitely
