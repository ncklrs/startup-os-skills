## Engagement Programs and Rituals

**Impact: HIGH**

Rituals create rhythm. Regular, predictable engagement opportunities transform occasional visitors into committed members. Communities with consistent rituals see 40-60% higher retention.

### The Engagement Hierarchy

```
COMMITMENT LEVEL (Low → High)
│
├── Consume        (Read, watch, lurk)
├── React          (Like, emoji, upvote)
├── Reply          (Comment, answer)
├── Create         (Post, share, write)
├── Organize       (Host, lead, moderate)
└── Evangelize     (Refer, represent, champion)
```

✗ No async option
✗ Time zone unfriendly
✗ No follow-up
✗ Unclear value prop
```

### Scaling Rituals

| Size | Approach |
|------|----------|
| **< 100** | Founder-led, high-touch, everyone knows everyone |
| **100-500** | Champions help run, multiple time zones |
| **500-2k** | Delegated to community team, recorded/async options |
| **2k+** | Regional/topic sub-communities, local leaders |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Too many rituals** — Member fatigue, none get traction
- **Inconsistent timing** — "Every other Tuesday-ish" doesn't work
- **No one shows up** — Launch without promotion, wonder why empty
- **Same participants** — Clique forms, others feel excluded
- **Founder burnout** — Running everything yourself isn't sustainable
- **Complex formats** — Keep it simple, especially early
- **No celebration** — Miss opportunity to recognize participants
- **Copy-paste other communities** — What works for them may not fit your culture
- **Ignoring feedback** — Ritual doesn't improve, participation dies
- **All synchronous** — Excludes members in different time zones
