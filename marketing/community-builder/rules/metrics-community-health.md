## Community Metrics and Health

**Impact: HIGH**

What gets measured gets managed — but measuring the wrong things destroys communities. Vanity metrics mislead; health metrics guide. Focus on engagement quality over quantity, and always connect community metrics to business impact.

### Core Community Metrics

| Category | Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Growth** | New members | Count per period | Track trend |
| **Growth** | Churn rate | Members lost / Total members | < 5%/month |
| **Growth** | Net growth | (New - Churned) / Total | > 5%/month early |
| **Engagement** | DAU | Daily active users | Track trend |
| **Engagement** | WAU | Weekly active users | Track trend |
| **Engagement** | MAU | Monthly active users | Track trend |
| **Engagement** | DAU/MAU ratio | DAU / MAU | 15-30% healthy |
| **Depth** | Posts per member | Posts / Active members | 0.5-2 |
| **Depth** | Response rate | Questions answered / Questions asked | > 80% |
| **Depth** | Contributor % | Members who post / Total members | 5-15% |
| **Health** | Time to first response | Median response time | < 24h |
| **Health** | Resolution rate | Questions resolved / Questions asked | > 70% |
| **Health** | Sentiment score | Positive / (Positive + Negative) | > 80% |

### The DAU/MAU Ratio (Stickiness)

```
DAU/MAU = Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users

Interpretation:
- 50%+ : Exceptional (daily habit)
- 30-50%: Strong (regular engagement)
- 15-30%: Healthy (weekly engagement)
- 10-15%: Moderate (casual engagement)
- <10%  : Weak (occasional visitors)

Context matters:
- Developer community: 20%+ is excellent
- Customer support community: 10-15% is normal
- Learning community: 15-25% is healthy
```

### Engagement Depth Metrics

| Metric | Description | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Lurker-to-poster ratio** | Posts / (Total members - Never posted) | Conversion to active |
| **Reply ratio** | Replies / Posts | Conversation depth |
| **Thread depth** | Avg replies per thread | Discussion quality |
| **Return rate** | Members who return within 7 days | Habit formation |
| **Contribution diversity** | Unique contributors / Total posts | Distribution health |

### The 1-9-90 Measurement

```
Typical Community Distribution:
- 1% Creators (post original content)
- 9% Contributors (reply, react, engage)
- 90% Lurkers (consume only)

Healthy Targets:
- Creators: 3-5%
- Contributors: 15-25%
- Lurkers: 70-80%

Measurement:
Creator % = Members with 3+ posts / Total members
Contributor % = Members with any interaction / Total members
Lurker % = Members with no interaction / Total members
```

### Health Indicators

**Positive Health Signs:**
```
✓ Questions get answered quickly (< 24h)
✓ Multiple members respond to questions
✓ New members stick around (D7 retention > 25%)
✓ Old members stay active (low churn)
✓ Sentiment is positive (> 80%)
✓ Content is diverse (not same few people)
✓ Peer-to-peer interactions happen
✓ Members refer others
```

**Warning Signs:**
```
✗ Questions go unanswered
✗ Same 5 people post everything
✗ New members disappear quickly
✗ Negative sentiment increasing
✗ Drama/conflict escalating
✗ Staff doing all the answering
✗ Spam increasing
✗ Members complaining about community
```

### Retention Cohort Analysis

| Cohort | D1 | D7 | D30 | D90 |
|--------|----|----|-----|-----|
| Jan | 45% | 28% | 18% | 12% |
| Feb | 48% | 32% | 22% | 15% |
| Mar | 52% | 35% | 24% | 17% |

**Reading the table:**
- D1: % of members who engage again within 1 day
- D7: % still active after 7 days
- D30: % still active after 30 days
- Improvement over time = better onboarding

### Business Impact Metrics

| Metric | Description | How to Measure |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Support deflection** | Questions answered by community vs support tickets | Compare volumes |
| **Community-influenced revenue** | Revenue from community-active accounts | Tag accounts, track revenue |
| **Time to value** | Onboarding speed for community members | Compare with non-members |
| **Expansion rate** | Upsell rate for community members | Compare with non-members |
| **Churn reduction** | Churn rate for community members | Compare with non-members |
| **NPS lift** | NPS of community members vs non-members | Survey both groups |

### Support Deflection Calculation

```
Method 1: Volume comparison
- Support tickets before community: 1,000/month
- Support tickets after community: 700/month
- Community questions answered: 400/month
- Deflection rate: (1000-700)/1000 = 30%

Method 2: Cost calculation
- Questions answered by community: 400/month
- Avg support ticket cost: $15
- Savings: 400 × $15 = $6,000/month

Method 3: Survey
- Survey community members
- "Did this answer prevent you from contacting support?"
- Calculate deflection %
```

### Community ROI Framework

```
Community Investment:
- Team salaries
- Platform costs
- Programs/events
- Tools/software
= Total Investment

Community Value:
- Support deflection savings
- Community-influenced revenue
- Reduced churn (retained revenue)
- Content/UGC value
- Referral value
= Total Value

ROI = (Total Value - Total Investment) / Total Investment
```

### Benchmarks by Community Type

| Community Type | DAU/MAU | Response Rate | D30 Retention |
|----------------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Developer** | 20-30% | 80-90% | 15-25% |
| **Customer Support** | 10-20% | 90%+ | 10-15% |
| **Professional** | 15-25% | 70-85% | 15-20% |
| **Learning** | 15-25% | 60-80% | 10-20% |
| **Consumer** | 25-40% | 50-70% | 10-15% |

### Bad Metrics Focus

```
Vanity Metrics to Avoid:
✗ Total member count (without engagement context)
✗ Impressions or views (without action)
✗ Followers (if not engaged)
✗ "Community size" without activity

Why they mislead:
- 100k members with 1% active = 1,000 active
- 10k members with 25% active = 2,500 active
- The smaller community is healthier

Better alternatives:
✓ Active members (WAU, MAU)
✓ Engagement rate (DAU/MAU)
✓ Retention (D7, D30)
✓ Business impact (revenue, deflection)
```

### Metric Review Cadence

| Frequency | Metrics | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Daily** | DAU, new members, urgent issues | Monitor, respond |
| **Weekly** | WAU, posts, response rate | Team review |
| **Monthly** | MAU, retention, health score | Report, adjust |
| **Quarterly** | Trends, business impact, ROI | Strategy review |
| **Annually** | Year-over-year, benchmarks | Planning |

### Tools for Measurement

| Tool Type | Examples | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Platform analytics** | Discord Insights, Slack Analytics, Circle | Basic engagement |
| **Community platforms** | Common Room, Orbit, Savannah | Member journeys |
| **BI tools** | Looker, Metabase, Tableau | Custom dashboards |
| **Surveys** | Typeform, SurveyMonkey | Qualitative feedback |
| **Sentiment** | Various NLP tools | Automated sentiment |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Measuring only growth** — Big community can be dead community
- **Ignoring retention** — Acquiring members you can't keep wastes effort
- **Vanity over value** — "100k members!" means nothing if they're inactive
- **No business connection** — Can't justify investment without ROI
- **Gaming metrics** — Engagement for engagement's sake
- **Over-measuring** — Drowning in data, no action
- **Under-measuring** — Flying blind, can't improve
- **Ignoring qualitative** — Numbers don't capture community feel
- **Comparing wrong benchmarks** — Your community is unique
- **Measuring too frequently** — Daily changes are noise, not signal
