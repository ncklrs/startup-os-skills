## Community-Led Growth Strategy

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Community-led growth (CLG) transforms your community from a support channel into a growth engine. Companies with strong communities see 5-25% of revenue influenced by community activities.

### Community-Led Growth Motions

| Motion | Description | Revenue Impact | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Community-Assisted** | Community helps users succeed | Support cost reduction | SaaS, complex products |
| **Community-Qualified** | Leads emerge from engagement | Pipeline generation | B2B, enterprise |
| **Community-Distributed** | Growth via member networks | Acquisition | Viral, consumer |
| **Community-Created** | Members build on platform | Ecosystem expansion | Platforms, APIs |

### CLG vs PLG vs SLG

| Dimension | Sales-Led (SLG) | Product-Led (PLG) | Community-Led (CLG) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Primary Driver** | Sales team | Product experience | Peer connections |
| **Trust Source** | Rep relationship | Product trial | Community proof |
| **Discovery** | Outbound, events | SEO, word of mouth | Community search, referrals |
| **Conversion** | Demo → Close | Trial → Convert | Engage → Trust → Convert |
| **Expansion** | Upsell calls | In-app prompts | Peer recommendations |
| **CAC** | Highest | Low-Medium | Lowest long-term |
| **Time to Impact** | Fastest | Medium | Slowest to build, fastest to compound |

### Community Strategy Canvas

| Element | Questions to Answer |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Purpose** | Why does this community exist beyond your product? |
| **Members** | Who are they? What unites them? |
| **Value** | What do members get that they can't get elsewhere? |
| **Differentiation** | Why this community vs competitors? |
| **Success Metrics** | How do you measure community health and business impact? |
| **Resources** | What investment is required? Team, tools, time? |

### Good Community Strategy

```
Purpose Statement:
"We're building a community of DevOps engineers who help each other
ship reliable software. Our product is one tool in their toolkit,
but the community serves their broader career and craft."

Value Proposition:
✓ Peer support for complex problems
✓ Career networking and job opportunities
✓ Early access to industry trends and tools
✓ Direct influence on product roadmap
✓ Recognition among peers

Growth Model:
- Content creates SEO discovery
- Free value builds trust
- Engaged members refer peers
- Champions amplify externally
```

### Bad Community Strategy

```
Purpose Statement:
"We're building a community to reduce support costs
and generate leads for the sales team."

Anti-patterns:
✗ Community is a thinly veiled sales channel
  → Members feel used, leave quickly

✗ Value flows one direction (company → members)
  → No peer-to-peer connection, no stickiness

✗ Success measured only in MQLs
  → Short-term extraction destroys long-term value

✗ No investment in community team
  → Founder does it part-time, community dies

✗ Launch to thousands immediately
  → No core group, no culture, chaos
```

### Community Positioning Framework

| Position | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Product-Centric** | Community around the product | "Figma Community" |
| **Practice-Centric** | Community around the craft | "DevOps community" (HashiCorp) |
| **Identity-Centric** | Community around who members are | "Women in Tech" |
| **Mission-Centric** | Community around shared cause | "Climate tech builders" |

**Recommendation:** Start product-centric, evolve to practice/identity-centric for sustainability.

### Building the Initial Core

```
Phase 1: Founding Members (0-50)
├── Handpick passionate early users
├── 1:1 conversations to understand needs
├── Invite-only, high-touch
└── Establish culture and norms

Phase 2: Early Community (50-500)
├── Open access with curation
├── First community programs
├── Champion identification
└── Early rituals established

Phase 3: Growing Community (500-5,000)
├── Scalable systems required
├── Moderation team needed
├── Sub-communities emerge
└── Governance becomes important

Phase 4: Scaled Community (5,000+)
├── Community runs itself (mostly)
├── Professional community team
├── Ecosystem thinking
└── Multiple touchpoints and programs
```

### CLG Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Community-Influenced Revenue** | Revenue from accounts active in community | 10-25% of total |
| **Community-Sourced Pipeline** | Deals originating from community | Track and grow |
| **Support Deflection** | Questions answered by community vs support | 30-50% |
| **Product Feedback Loop** | Feature requests from community shipped | Track velocity |
| **Net Promoter Score (Community)** | NPS of community members vs non-members | +10-20 points higher |
| **Time to Value** | Onboarding speed for community members | 30-50% faster |
| **Expansion Revenue** | Upsell rate for community members | 20-40% higher |

### CLG Investment Model

| Stage | Team | Budget (% of Marketing) |
|-------|------|-------------------------|
| **Early (0-1k members)** | 0.5-1 FTE (often founder) | 2-5% |
| **Growing (1-10k)** | 1-3 FTE | 5-10% |
| **Scaling (10-50k)** | 3-7 FTE | 10-15% |
| **Mature (50k+)** | 7+ FTE, specialized roles | 15-20% |

### Community-Product Integration

| Integration | Description | Impact |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **In-app community access** | Join community from product | Increases adoption |
| **SSO/account linking** | Same identity in both | Reduces friction |
| **Activity sync** | Product usage → community recognition | Gamification |
| **Feature requests** | Community votes → roadmap | Product-market fit |
| **Beta access** | Community members get early access | Loyalty, feedback |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Lead gen disguised as community** — Members sense transactional intent, trust dies
- **No clear purpose** — "Community" without shared identity fails
- **Measuring only business metrics** — Miss community health, optimize for extraction
- **Underinvesting in team** — Communities need dedicated attention to thrive
- **Scaling before culture** — Growth without norms creates chaos
- **Ignoring community feedback** — Members who feel unheard leave
- **Separating community from product** — Integration creates network effects
- **Expecting immediate ROI** — Community compounds; give it 12-18 months
