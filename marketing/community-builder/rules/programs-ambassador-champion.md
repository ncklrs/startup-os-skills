## Ambassador and Champion Programs

| **MVP** | Product expertise | Technical depth | 10-50 selected members |
| **Advocate** | Brand amplification | Marketing reach | Varies |
| **Moderator** | Community governance | Operational | 1-3% of active members |

### Champion vs Ambassador

|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Focus** | Helping members internally | Representing externally |
| **Activities** | Answering questions, welcoming | Speaking, writing, evangelizing |
| **Visibility** | High inside community | High outside community |
| **Selection** | Emerge naturally, formalize | Apply/invite, selective |
| **Commitment** | Ongoing, flexible | Formal, structured |
| **Rewards** | Recognition, access | Tangible + recognition |

### Bad Ambassador Program

```
Program: "[Product] VIPs"

Problems:

  "Help spread the word when you can"

✗ Unclear benefits
  "Exclusive access and perks"
  → Sounds like marketing, not real value

✗ No structure
  → Enthusiastic launch, dies in 3 months

✗ One-size-fits-all
  → High performers feel same as inactive

✗ No community among ambassadors
  → Isolated, not connected to each other

✗ Take, don't give
  → Expect content, provide nothing
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Ambassador in name only** — Badge without real benefits or access
- **Too many ambassadors** — Dilutes meaning, hard to manage
- **No accountability** — Accept everyone, expect nothing
- **One-way extraction** — Take content, give nothing back
- **Ignoring ambassadors** — Launch program, forget about them
- **No community** — Ambassadors don't know each other
- **Static program** — Same benefits forever, no progression
- **Heavy-handed requirements** — Mandate specific activities, kill authenticity
- **Poor offboarding** — Inactive ambassadors stay, program credibility suffers
- **No feedback loop** — Don't ask ambassadors what they want
