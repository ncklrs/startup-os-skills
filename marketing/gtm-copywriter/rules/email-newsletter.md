## Newsletter Copy

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Newsletters build long-term relationships. Consistency and value over promotion.

### Newsletter Formats

| Format | Structure | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Curated** | 5-7 links with commentary | Industry news, resources |
| **Single essay** | One deep topic | Thought leadership |
| **Product update** | What's new + what's next | Customer communication |
| **Mixed** | Update + content + links | General engagement |

### The 90/10 Rule

90% value, 10% promotion (max).

```
✓ 4 useful insights → 1 subtle product mention
✗ 1 intro → 4 product pitches
```

### Good Newsletter Structure

```
[Compelling subject line]

[Hook - Why should I read this today?]

[Main content - The value you promised]

[Secondary content - Additional resources/links]

[Soft CTA - Optional, non-pushy]

[Sign-off - Personal touch]
```

### Newsletter Voice

More personal than product emails. You're a trusted source, not a salesperson.

**Good:**
```
Three things caught my attention this week:

1. Cloudflare's post-mortem on their latest outage was
   remarkably honest. Here's what I learned from it...

2. The "shift left on security" movement is finally
   hitting secrets management. I have thoughts...

3. We shipped something I've wanted for 2 years.
```

**Bad:**
```
Happy Friday! 🎉

Here's what's new at SecretStash this month:
- Feature A (click here!)
- Feature B (try it now!)
- Feature C (upgrade to access!)

Buy our stuff!
```

### Subject Line Patterns for Newsletters

```
✓ "The security practice I wish I'd learned earlier"
✓ "3 things I noticed at KubeCon"
✓ "Why .env files are still winning (unfortunately)"
✓ "This week: secrets, scandals, and serverless"

✗ "SecretStash Newsletter #47"
✗ "Your monthly update"
✗ "Newsletter: January Edition"
```

### Consistency Matters

- Same day/time each week/month
- Predictable format readers can rely on
- Consistent voice (even with multiple authors)

### Anti-Patterns

- Irregular schedule (destroys habit)
- All promotion, no value
- Wall of text with no structure
- Generic "hope this finds you well" openings
