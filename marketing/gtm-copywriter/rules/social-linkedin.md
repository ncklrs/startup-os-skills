## LinkedIn Post Copy

**Impact: HIGH**

LinkedIn rewards authenticity and professional insight. Not corporate-speak, not viral hacks—genuine value.

### LinkedIn Post Types

| Type | Purpose | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Story** | Build connection | Personal narrative |
| **Insight** | Share expertise | Observation + framework |
| **Contrarian** | Challenge thinking | Hot take + reasoning |
| **How-to** | Provide value | Tactical breakdown |
| **Celebration** | Milestone sharing | Achievement + lessons |
| **Question** | Start conversation | Genuine inquiry |

### The Hook is Everything

First 2 lines show before "see more." Make them count.

**Good Hooks:**
```
I mass-deleted 47 API keys from Slack last week.
For the third time this year.

"We don't have a secrets problem."
That's what I told our security team 6 months ago.
I was wrong.

Hot take: Your .env files are a liability, not an asset.

After 10 years in DevOps, I've realized one uncomfortable truth:
```

**Bad Hooks:**
```
I'm excited to share some thoughts on secrets management!

---

Happy Monday everyone! Hope you had a great weekend.

In today's digital landscape, security is more important than ever.

### Optimal Format

```
[Hook - 1-2 lines that stop the scroll]

[Line break]

[Story or context - what happened?]

[Line break]

[Insight - what did you learn?]

[Line break]

[Takeaway - what should reader do?]

[Line break]

[CTA - optional question or invitation]
```

### Formatting Tricks

- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Line breaks between paragraphs
- Use "↳" or "→" for emphasis
- Numbered lists for frameworks
- Avoid walls of text

### Good Post Example

```
I spent 3 years building the wrong product.

Not wrong as in "bad execution."
Wrong as in "nobody wanted it."

We had great code. Clean architecture. Comprehensive tests.
But we never asked: "Would someone pay for this?"

Here's what I do differently now:

1. Talk to 10 customers before writing code
2. Charge money from day 1 (even if it's $1)
3. Build the smallest thing that delivers value
4. Measure usage, not "excitement"

The best code is code that solves real problems.
Everything else is just practice.

What's a lesson you learned the expensive way?

### Engagement Tactics (Non-Gimmicky)

- End with genuine question
- Tag relevant people (sparingly, with value)
- Reply to every comment in first hour
- Post when your audience is active (test this)

### Anti-Patterns

- **Broetry** — One. Word. Sentences. For. Effect.
- **Humble bragging** — "So honored to be recognized..."
- **Engagement bait** — "Comment YES if you agree!"
- **Fake stories** — "A homeless man taught me about business..."
- **Corporate PR voice** — "We're thrilled to announce..."
