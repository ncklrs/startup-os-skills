## Email Body Structure

**Impact: HIGH**

Structure determines whether your email gets read or skimmed and deleted.

### The Inverted Pyramid

Most important information first. Assume they only read the first 2 sentences.

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│     CORE MESSAGE            │  ← First 2 lines
├─────────────────────────────┤
│     Supporting details      │  ← If they keep reading
├─────────────────────────────┤
│     Additional context      │  ← For the invested
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Optimal Email Structure

```
[Hook - 1-2 sentences that earn the next paragraph]

[Value - What's in it for them, why it matters]

[Details - Supporting information, proof, specifics]

[CTA - One clear action]

[Sign-off]
```

### Good Example

```
Your secrets are about to get a lot safer.

We just shipped environments—separate secrets for dev, staging,
and production. No more "did I just deploy with test credentials?"
moments.

Here's what's new:
• Isolated environments with one-click switching
• Environment-specific access controls
• Automatic validation before deploys

→ Try environments now

### Bad Example

```
Hi there!

Hope you're having a great week! We've been really busy here
at SecretStash and we're so excited to share some news with you.

Our team has been working really hard for the past few months
on something we think you're going to love. We listened to your
feedback and we're proud to announce...

[3 more paragraphs before getting to the point]
```

### Formatting for Scanability

| Element | Use For |
|---------|---------|
| **Bold** | Key phrases, benefits |
| Bullets | Lists of 3+ items |
| Short paragraphs | Every 2-3 sentences max |
| White space | Breathing room |
| → Arrow CTA | Drawing eye to action |

### Length Guidelines

| Email Type | Ideal Length |
|------------|--------------|
| Cold outreach | 50-100 words |
| Feature announcement | 100-150 words |
| Newsletter section | 150-200 words |
| Nurture/educational | 200-400 words |

### One CTA Rule

Every email should have ONE primary call-to-action.

```
✓ "Try environments now"
✓ "Update your payment method"
✓ "Read the full guide"

✗ "Try it now, read the docs, follow us on Twitter,
   and check out our blog post"
```

### Anti-Pattern

The "wall of text" email. If it looks dense, it won't get read.
