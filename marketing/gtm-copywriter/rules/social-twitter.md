## Twitter/X Post Copy

**Impact: HIGH**

Twitter rewards personality, speed, and genuine engagement. Be human, be fast, be interesting.

### Twitter Content Types

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Hot take** | Opinion + reasoning | "Unpopular opinion: .env files were a mistake" |
| **Thread** | Numbered insights | "10 things I learned building a CLI (thread)" |
| **Announcement** | News + context | "shipped environments today. here's why it matters:" |
| **Reply guy** | Valuable addition | Adding insight to others' posts |
| **Quote tweet** | Commentary | Your take on someone else's post |
| **Shitpost** | Humor | Meme, joke, relatable content |

### Single Tweet Principles

- Front-load the interesting part
- No corporate speak
- Lowercase is fine (often preferred)
- Personality > perfection

**Good Tweets:**
```
shipped environments today

no more "oh god was that the prod database" moments

---

hot take: most "secrets management" solutions are just
encrypted .env files with extra steps

---

the scariest message in engineering:
"can someone DM me the prod credentials real quick"

---

spent 6 hours debugging
it was a typo in an env var
we don't talk about today
```

**Bad Tweets:**
```
We're excited to announce the launch of our new
Environments feature! This groundbreaking addition
to SecretStash will revolutionize how you manage...

In today's fast-paced development environment,
managing secrets across multiple deployment stages
is increasingly important. That's why we...

### Thread Structure

```
1/ [Hook that stands alone as a tweet]

2/ [Context - why you're sharing this]

3-8/ [The meat - insights, steps, points]

9/ [Summary or key takeaway]

10/ [CTA - follow, try, discuss]
```

### Thread Tips

- First tweet must work standalone (it gets retweeted alone)
- Number your tweets (1/, 2/, 3/ or 1. 2. 3.)
- Each tweet should deliver value independently
- End with clear takeaway and CTA
- 5-12 tweets is ideal length

### Good Thread Example

```
1/ shipped my first CLI tool after 10 years of web dev

here's everything i learned (thread):

2/ the hardest part isn't the code

it's understanding how people actually use terminals

web: you control the environment
cli: you're a guest in their shell

3/ error messages matter 10x more

on web: show a toast, highlight a field
in cli: a bad error = user closes the terminal and never comes back

[continues...]

10/ if you're thinking about building a CLI:

just do it. the mental model shift made me a better developer.

### Voice on Twitter

- Lowercase often feels more natural
- Contractions always
- Fragments are fine
- Emoji: use sparingly for personality
- "lol" and "tbh" are acceptable

### Engagement

- Reply to replies (the algorithm rewards it)
- Quote tweet with value-add, not just "this"
- Join conversations in your space
- Don't just broadcast—interact

### Anti-Patterns

- **Corporate voice** — "We're thrilled to announce"
- **Thread as blog post** — Dense paragraphs don't work
- **Asking for retweets** — Let it earn engagement
- **Too many hashtags** — 0-1 is fine
- **Only self-promotion** — 80% value, 20% promotion
