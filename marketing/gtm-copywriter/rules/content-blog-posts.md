sitting in public channels. And we're a security company.

### Bad Blog Opening

### SEO Without Sacrificing Quality

- **Target keyword in H1** — But make it natural
- **Related terms throughout** — Don't stuff, write naturally
- **Answer the search intent** — What did they actually want to know?
- **Headers that scan** — Someone should get value from headers alone

### Formatting for Readability

- Paragraphs: 2-4 sentences max
- Use subheadings every 300 words
- Bullet lists for 3+ items
- Code blocks for technical content
- Bold key phrases (sparingly)
- Images/diagrams to break up text

### Anti-Patterns

- **Keyword stuffing** — Destroys readability for marginal SEO gain
- **Burying the lead** — Get to the point in the first paragraph
- **No skimmability** — Dense paragraphs with no visual breaks
- **Weak conclusions** — "In conclusion, secrets are important"
