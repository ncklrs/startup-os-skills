## Email Sequence Design

**Impact: HIGH**

Sequences are conversations over time. Each email should build on the last.

### Sequence Types

| Type | Goal | Typical Length |
|------|------|----------------|
| Welcome/Onboarding | Activate new users | 4-7 emails over 14 days |
| Nurture | Build trust pre-purchase | 5-10 emails over 30 days |
| Trial conversion | Convert to paid | 3-5 emails during trial |
| Re-engagement | Win back inactive | 3-4 emails over 14 days |
| Post-purchase | Retain and expand | Ongoing, monthly+ |

### Welcome Sequence Blueprint

```
Email 1 (Immediate): Welcome + single next step
Email 2 (Day 1): Quick win / first value
Email 3 (Day 3): Deeper feature education
Email 4 (Day 5): Social proof / case study
Email 5 (Day 7): Check-in + offer help
Email 6 (Day 10): Advanced use case
Email 7 (Day 14): Milestone celebration or nudge
```

### Sequence Flow Principles

**1. Progressive disclosure**
Don't overwhelm. One concept per email.

**2. Behavior-based branching**
- Completed action? → Skip the nudge, advance the topic
- Didn't complete? → Offer help, address objections

**3. Exit conditions**
Stop the sequence when they:
- Complete the goal
- Convert to next stage
- Unsubscribe or disengage

**4. Value before ask**
Give value in emails 1-3 before asking for anything.

### Good Sequence Example (Trial)

```
Day 0: "Your trial is live" — Install CLI
Day 2: "Your first secret in 60 seconds" — Quick start
Day 4: "3 teams who cut onboarding time 80%" — Social proof
Day 7: "Halfway through your trial" — Usage summary
Day 12: "2 days left" — Urgency + offer help
Day 14: "Trial ended" — Clear path to upgrade
```

### Timing Guidelines

| Sequence Stage | Spacing |
|----------------|---------|
| Early (1-3) | 1-2 days apart |
| Middle (4-6) | 2-3 days apart |
| Late (7+) | 3-5 days apart |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Same cadence for everyone** — Power users need less hand-holding
- **No exit conditions** — Sending "did you try X?" after they tried X
- **Purely promotional** — Every email asks for something
- **No story arc** — Emails feel disconnected, not sequential
