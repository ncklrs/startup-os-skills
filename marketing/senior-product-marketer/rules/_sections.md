## 1. Trial Acquisition (trial)
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Getting qualified users to sign up. Focus on value proposition clarity, friction reduction, and trust building. A 10% improvement here compounds through the entire funnel.

## 2. Activation & First Value (activation)
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** The make-or-break moment. Users who don't reach "aha" within the first session rarely return. Optimize for speed-to-value, not feature completeness.

## 3. Freemium to Paid Conversion (conversion)
**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Monetization without manipulation. Focus on demonstrating value before asking for payment, strategic friction in free tier, and expansion revenue.
