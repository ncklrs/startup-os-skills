## Strategic Social Proof

**Impact: HIGH**

Social proof reduces perceived risk. Match proof type to objection.

### Proof Hierarchy (by impact)

1. **Metrics:** "50,000 teams trust us" (scale)
2. **Logos:** Recognizable customer logos (credibility)
3. **Testimonials:** Specific results with attribution (relatability)
4. **Case studies:** Deep dives (consideration stage)
5. **Reviews:** G2/Capterra badges (validation)

### Testimonial Formula

**[Specific result] + [Context] + [Attribution]**

```
Bad:
"Great product! Love using it every day."
— John D.

Good:
"Cut our support response time from 4 hours to 15 minutes.
Our CSAT went from 72% to 91%."
— Sarah Chen, Head of Support at Stripe
```

### Logo Selection

- Choose logos your target audience aspires to
- Include one "surprising" logo (unexpected industry)
- Show 5-7 logos max (paradox of choice)
- Grayscale is cleaner, color for emphasis

### Placement Strategy

| Page Section | Best Proof Type |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Above fold | Metric ("Join 50k+ teams") |
| Below hero | Logo strip |
| Features | Relevant testimonials |
| Pricing | ROI case study |
| Checkout | Trust badges, reviews |

### Anti-Pattern

"Trusted by industry leaders" with no logos shown. Generic claims hurt more than help.
