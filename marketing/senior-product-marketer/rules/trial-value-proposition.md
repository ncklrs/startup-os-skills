## Clear Value Proposition

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Your headline has 3 seconds to answer "What is this and why should I care?"

### The Formula

**[Outcome] + [For whom] + [Differentiator]**

### Bad Examples

```
"The All-in-One Platform for Modern Teams"
→ Generic, could be anything

"Revolutionizing the Way You Work"
→ Meaningless buzzwords

"Powerful. Simple. Fast."
→ Adjectives without substance
```

### Good Examples

```
"Send invoices that get paid 2x faster"
→ Specific outcome with quantified benefit

"The CRM that sales teams actually use"
→ Addresses real pain (CRM adoption)

"Replace 5 tools with one workspace"
→ Clear value prop with specificity
```

### Checklist

- [ ] Can a 5-year-old understand what you do?
- [ ] Does it mention a specific outcome?
- [ ] Is it different from competitors?
- [ ] Does it address a real pain point?

### Anti-Pattern

"We're the Uber of X" or any analogy-based positioning. Make users understand, not decode.
