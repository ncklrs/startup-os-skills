## Preemptive Objection Handling

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Address objections before they become barriers. Know what stops people.

### Common SaaS Objections

| Objection | Preemptive Solution |
|-----------|---------------------|
| "Too expensive" | Show ROI, offer trial, display per-user pricing |
| "Too complex" | Demo video, "Get started in 5 min" copy |
| "Is my data safe?" | Security badges, compliance logos, privacy policy link |
| "Will it integrate?" | Integration logos, API mention |
| "What if I need help?" | "Chat with us" widget, support hours |
| "Can I cancel?" | "Cancel anytime" badge near CTA |
| "Do I need a credit card?" | "No credit card required" under CTA |

### FAQ Placement

**Above fold:** Most critical objection (usually security or pricing)
**Below features:** Integration and technical concerns
**Before CTA:** Commitment concerns (cancel, trial length)
**Footer:** Legal and detailed policies

### Objection-Handling Copy Patterns

```
Instead of: "Enterprise-grade security"
Write: "Bank-level encryption. SOC 2 compliant. Your data never leaves your control."

Instead of: "Easy to use"
Write: "Most teams are up and running in under 10 minutes. No training required."

Instead of: "Great support"
Write: "Real humans respond in under 2 hours. No chatbots, no runaround."
```

### Risk Reversal

Shift risk from buyer to seller:

- "30-day money-back guarantee"
- "We'll migrate your data for free"
- "If you don't save 10 hours/week, we'll refund you"

### Anti-Pattern

Burying objection answers in a collapsed FAQ at page bottom. Surface answers where objections arise.
