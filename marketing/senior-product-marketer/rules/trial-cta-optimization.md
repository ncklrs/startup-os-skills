## CTA Optimization

**Impact: HIGH**

Your CTA is the bridge between interest and action. Every word matters.

### The Hierarchy

**Best → Worst:**

1. "Start free trial" (low commitment, clear value)
2. "Get started free" (action-oriented)
3. "Try for free" (try implies no commitment)
4. "Sign up free" (signup feels like work)
5. "Create account" (account = obligation)
6. "Get started" (what's the cost?)
7. "Submit" (submit to what?)

### Button Copy Formula

**[Action verb] + [Benefit/Object] + [Reducer]**

```
Examples:
- "Start building free"
- "Send your first invoice"
- "Get my free report"
- "Start 14-day trial"
```

### Anxiety Reducers

Add micro-copy below CTAs to address objections:

```
[Start Free Trial]
No credit card required • Cancel anytime

[Get Started]
Free forever for up to 3 users

[Book a Demo]
30 min • No commitment • Get your questions answered
```

### Visual Hierarchy

- Primary CTA: Solid, high-contrast color
- Secondary CTA: Outlined or ghost button
- Only ONE primary CTA above fold
- Repeat CTA after each value section

### Anti-Patterns

- "Learn more" as primary CTA (kicks the can)
- Multiple competing CTAs ("Sign up" vs "Book demo" vs "Watch video")
- CTA color that blends with design
