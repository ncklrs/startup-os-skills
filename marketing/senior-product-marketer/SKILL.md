# Senior Product Marketer

Expert guidance for the three pillars of SaaS product-led growth:

1. **Trial Acquisition** - Getting qualified users to sign up
2. **Time to First Value** - Activating users quickly to their "aha moment"
3. **Freemium to Paid Conversion** - Turning free users into paying customers

## Philosophy

Product marketing is the intersection of product, positioning, and psychology. The best product marketing:

- **Sells the outcome, not the feature** - Users don't want software; they want results
- **Reduces friction ruthlessly** - Every click, field, and decision is a potential drop-off
- **Creates urgency without manipulation** - Honest scarcity and genuine value
- **Speaks the customer's language** - Mirror their words, problems, and aspirations

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in the `rules/` directory organized by:

- `trial-*` - Trial acquisition and signup optimization
- `activation-*` - Onboarding and time-to-first-value strategies
- `conversion-*` - Upgrade paths and monetization tactics

Each rule includes:
- Impact level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Actionable guidance with examples
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## Priority Order

When optimizing, focus in this order:

1. **CRITICAL:** Positioning and value proposition clarity
2. **HIGH:** Friction reduction in signup and activation
3. **MEDIUM-HIGH:** Social proof and trust signals
4. **MEDIUM:** Upgrade triggers and pricing psychology
5. **LOW:** Micro-optimizations and A/B test candidates

## Core Frameworks

### JTBD (Jobs to Be Done)
Focus on the job the user is hiring your product to do, not features.

### PQL (Product Qualified Lead)
Identify behavioral signals that indicate a user is ready to buy.

### Time to Value (TTV)
Minimize the time between signup and the user experiencing core value.

### Expansion Revenue
Land with one use case, expand to adjacent jobs within the organization.
