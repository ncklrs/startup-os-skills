## Press Release Writing

**Impact: CRITICAL**

A press release is a formatted announcement, not a story. Its job is to give journalists the facts they need to decide if there's a story worth writing.

### Press Release Structure

| Section | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Headline** | Capture attention, convey news | 10-15 words |
| **Subheadline** | Add context or key detail | 15-20 words |
| **Dateline** | Location and date | City, State — Month Day, Year |
| **Lead paragraph** | Who, what, when, where, why | 2-3 sentences |
| **Body paragraphs** | Details, context, significance | 2-4 paragraphs |
| **Quote 1** | Executive perspective (vision) | 2-3 sentences |
| **Quote 2** | Customer/partner validation | 2-3 sentences |
| **Boilerplate** | Company description | 3-4 sentences |
| **Media contact** | PR contact information | Name, email, phone |

### The Lead Paragraph Formula

```
[Company name] today announced [what happened], enabling [who benefits]
to [key benefit]. The [product/partnership/milestone] represents [why
it matters] and will be available [when/how].
```

### Good Press Release Headlines

```
✓ "Acme Raises $50M Series B to Expand AI-Powered DevOps Platform"
  → Clear news (funding), specific amount, what it enables

✓ "Acme Launches Open-Source Alternative to Terraform, Backed by 10,000 GitHub Stars"
  → News (launch), differentiation (open-source), social proof (stars)

✓ "Acme Partners with AWS to Bring Zero-Trust Security to Enterprise Cloud"
  → Notable partner, specific technology, target market

✓ "Acme Report: 73% of Engineering Teams Lack Visibility Into CI/CD Costs"
  → Data-driven, specific percentage, clear topic
```

### Bad Press Release Headlines

```
✗ "Acme Announces Exciting New Product"
  → Vague, no news value, "exciting" is opinion

✗ "Acme: Revolutionizing the Future of Work with Innovative Solutions"
  → Buzzword soup, says nothing specific

✗ "Press Release: Acme Inc."
  → Literally no information

✗ "Acme Continues to Lead the Industry"
  → Self-congratulatory, not news
```

### Writing Effective Quotes

Quotes should sound human, not like legal approved them into oblivion.

| Good Quote Characteristics | Bad Quote Characteristics |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Adds perspective not in body | Repeats what's already written |
| Sounds like spoken words | Reads like a legal document |
| Expresses vision or emotion | Generic corporate platitudes |
| Specific to this announcement | Could apply to any company |

### Good Quote Examples

```
✓ "When we started Acme, developers told us they spent 30% of their time
   on infrastructure instead of building products. This funding lets us
   finally solve that at scale."
   → Specific, origin story, connects to news

✓ "We evaluated six vendors, and Acme was the only one that could handle
   our 10,000+ microservices without requiring a dedicated team."
   → Third-party validation, specific proof point

✓ "This isn't just a product launch—it's our answer to the security
   theater we've all been putting up with for a decade."
   → Opinionated, memorable, positions against status quo
```

### Bad Quote Examples

```
✗ "We are thrilled to announce this exciting partnership that will
   deliver tremendous value to our customers."
   → Generic, could be any company, any announcement

✗ "Acme is committed to innovation and excellence in everything we do."
   → Empty platitude, not specific to news

✗ "This strategic initiative aligns with our mission to leverage
   synergies and drive digital transformation."
   → Buzzword bingo, meaningless
```

### Boilerplate Template

```
About [Company Name]

[Company] [what you do in one sentence]. Founded in [year], the company
[key differentiation or approach]. [Company] is trusted by [customer
proof: names, numbers, or categories] and has [notable achievement:
funding, growth, recognition]. [Company] is headquartered in [location]
with [team size or office presence]. For more information, visit
[website] or follow [@handle] on [platform].
```

### News Value Checklist

Before sending a press release, verify:

- [ ] Is this actually news? (Something happened, not "we exist")
- [ ] Would a journalist's reader care about this?
- [ ] Is there a specific number, date, or name?
- [ ] Is this timely? (Happening now or very soon)
- [ ] Is there a credible third-party voice?
- [ ] Does the headline convey the news?
- [ ] Can I explain why this matters in one sentence?

### Distribution Timing

| Day | Effectiveness | Why |
|-----|---------------|-----|
| **Tuesday** | Best | Journalists past Monday backlog |
| **Wednesday** | Good | Solid mid-week attention |
| **Thursday** | Moderate | Friday approaches, attention fades |
| **Monday** | Low | Inbox overload from weekend |
| **Friday** | Avoid | Weekend burial unless intentional |

**Time:** 6-8am ET for business press, allows full news day

### Press Release Types

| Type | When to Use | Key Elements |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Product launch** | New product or major feature | Demo access, pricing, availability |
| **Funding** | Investment round closes | Amount, investors, use of funds |
| **Partnership** | Strategic alliance | Both parties quoted, joint value |
| **Executive hire** | C-suite addition | Background, why they joined |
| **Milestone** | Users, revenue, growth metric | Specific numbers, context |
| **Research/data** | Original findings | Methodology, key stats, full report |
| **Acquisition** | M&A announcement | Terms (if disclosed), integration |
| **Award/recognition** | Industry recognition | Criteria, competition, quote from org |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Burying the lead** — News in paragraph 3, fluff in paragraph 1
- **Quote-as-announcement** — Putting the actual news only in a quote
- **Jargon overload** — "Leveraging AI-powered blockchain synergies"
- **Length without substance** — 1,000 words when 400 would do
- **Missing the "so what"** — What happened, but not why it matters
- **Fake exclusivity** — "Industry-first" when it's not
- **Quote-stuffing** — Five executives all saying the same thing
- **Embargo-only distribution** — No follow-up after embargo lifts
