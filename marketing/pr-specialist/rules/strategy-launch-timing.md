## Launch Timing and News Calendar

**Impact: HIGH**

The best announcement on the wrong day gets buried. Strategic timing maximizes coverage and impact—understanding the news cycle is as important as the news itself.

### News Cycle Fundamentals

| Time Period | Characteristics | Strategy |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Morning (6-10am ET)** | Journalists setting daily agenda | Best for breaking news |
| **Midday (10am-2pm ET)** | Story development, interviews | Good for follow-up availability |
| **Afternoon (2-6pm ET)** | Deadline crunch, filing stories | Hard to get attention |
| **Evening/overnight** | Limited coverage, next-day pickup | Avoid unless strategic |

### Day of Week Analysis

| Day | Effectiveness | Best For | Avoid |
|-----|---------------|----------|-------|
| **Monday** | Low-Medium | Week-long campaigns | Major breaking news |
| **Tuesday** | High | Most announcements | — |
| **Wednesday** | High | Product launches, research | — |
| **Thursday** | Medium | Feature pieces, embargoes | Time-sensitive news |
| **Friday** | Low | Burying bad news (not recommended) | Anything you want covered |
| **Saturday/Sunday** | Very Low | Emergency only | Everything else |

### Optimal Timing by Announcement Type

| Announcement | Best Day | Best Time | Embargo Lift |
|--------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Funding** | Tuesday-Wednesday | 6am ET | Yes |
| **Product launch** | Tuesday-Wednesday | 6am ET | Yes |
| **Partnership** | Tuesday-Thursday | 6am ET | Usually |
| **Executive hire** | Tuesday-Thursday | 6am ET | Optional |
| **Research/report** | Wednesday | 6am ET | Yes |
| **Acquisition** | Tuesday-Wednesday | 6am ET | Sometimes |
| **Earnings/results** | After market close | 4pm+ ET | No |

### Calendar Considerations

**Avoid these periods:**

| Period | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **Major holidays** | Skeleton newsroom crews |
| **Between Christmas-New Year** | News desert |
| **Summer Fridays** | Reduced attention |
| **Election days** | All attention elsewhere |
| **Major industry events** | Competing for attention |
| **Earnings weeks** | Financial press distracted |
| **Breaking news days** | Unpredictable, monitor and delay |

**Leverage these periods:**

| Period | Opportunity |
|--------|-------------|
| **Industry conferences** | Concentrated audience, press present |
| **Earnings calls (of big players)** | Draft off market attention |
| **January** | Fresh budgets, "year ahead" stories |
| **September** | Post-summer return, planning season |

### Building Your Announcement Calendar

```
Annual Planning:

Q1:
├── January: New Year trends, predictions
├── February: Post-earnings, budget season
└── March: Q1 launches before quarter end

Q2:
├── April: Spring launches
├── May: Pre-summer pushes
└── June: Early summer (slower)

Q3:
├── July: Slowest month (avoid major news)
├── August: Pre-back-to-business
└── September: Back-to-business surge

Q4:
├── October: Fall campaigns
├── November: Pre-holiday (before Thanksgiving)
└── December: Year-end recaps, avoid major launches
```

### Competitive Timing

```
Competitor announcement imminent?

Option A: Go before
├── Beat them to market
├── Forces them to respond to you
└── Risk: Rushing, quality suffers

Option B: Go same day (counter-programming)
├── Draft off their attention
├── Provide alternative story
└── Risk: Gets lost in their coverage

Option C: Wait
├── Let their news cycle fade
├── Stand alone with your story
└── Risk: Perception of being second

Decision factors:
├── Newsworthiness of your announcement
├── How directly competitive is the news?
├── Your relationship with key journalists
└── Quality of your announcement readiness
```

### Coordinating with Business Calendar

| Business Event | PR Timing Strategy |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Product launch** | PR embargo lifts at or before GA |
| **Conference keynote** | Embargo lifts during/after keynote |
| **Funding close** | Announce within 1-2 weeks of close |
| **Executive start date** | Announce on or near first day |
| **Quarterly earnings** | Coordinate with investor relations |
| **Major customer win** | After contract signed, customer approved |

### News Cycle Disruptions

When breaking news dominates the cycle:

```
Assessment:
├── Is this a 1-hour story or multi-day?
├── Does it compete for same journalists?
├── Is there any connection to your news?
└── Can you delay 24-48 hours?

Options:
├── Delay: Safest if your news can wait
├── Proceed: If news is time-sensitive or unrelated
├── Pivot: If you can connect to breaking story
└── Cancel: If news is no longer relevant
```

### Good Timing Decisions

```
✓ Funding announcement on Tuesday at 6am ET with 48-hour embargo
  → Peak day, time for west coast, journalist prep time

✓ Delaying launch by one day due to major industry acquisition news
  → Prioritizes coverage over arbitrary date

✓ Aligning product launch with industry conference keynote
  → Captive audience, concentrated press

✓ Scheduling exec interview for 10am ET on announcement day
  → Available when journalists are writing
```

### Bad Timing Decisions

```
✗ Major product launch on Friday before Labor Day weekend
  → Minimal coverage, lost in holiday news desert

✗ Funding announcement same day as Apple keynote
  → Competing with overwhelming tech coverage

✗ Breaking embargo to beat competitor by 2 hours
  → Damages journalist relationships permanently

✗ Announcing at 5pm ET "to make tomorrow's news"
  → Missed today's cycle, may miss tomorrow's too
```

### Timezone Coordination

| Target Audience | Embargo Lift Time | Rationale |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **US national** | 6am ET | Full news day coverage |
| **US tech** | 6am PT (9am ET) | West coast journalist friendly |
| **Global** | 6am ET | US + Europe afternoon |
| **Europe-focused** | 6am GMT | European news cycle |
| **Asia-focused** | 6am local | Regional coverage priority |

### Contingency Planning

Build flexibility into your timing:

```
Primary date: Tuesday, March 15, 6am ET
Backup date: Wednesday, March 16, 6am ET
Fallback date: Monday, March 21, 6am ET

Triggers for backup:
├── Major breaking news dominates cycle
├── Key journalist unavailable
├── Technical/legal delay
├── Competitor timing conflict
└── Customer reference backing out

Communication plan:
├── Pre-draft delay notice to embargoed journalists
├── Internal stakeholder notification process
├── Customer/partner coordination
└── Social/marketing asset flexibility
```

### Announcement Sequencing

For multiple related announcements:

```
Option A: Single big bang
├── All news in one release
├── Maximum single-day impact
└── Risk: Muddled message, too much to cover

Option B: Staggered announcements
├── Space 1-2 weeks apart
├── Multiple coverage opportunities
└── Risk: Fatigue, later news seems smaller

Option C: Primary + follow-on
├── Major news first, supporting news follows
├── Builds narrative over time
└── Works well for product launch + customer wins

Sequencing factors:
├── How related is the news?
├── Can each piece stand alone?
├── What story arc do you want to tell?
└── What coverage cadence can you sustain?
```

### Real-Time Monitoring

On announcement day:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| **-24 hours** | Final check, embargo reminder sent |
| **-1 hour** | Verify release ready, team on standby |
| **0 (embargo lift)** | Wire distribution, monitoring begins |
| **+1-2 hours** | Initial coverage lands, share/engage |
| **+4 hours** | Assess coverage, thank journalists |
| **+24 hours** | Follow-up pitches to non-covered outlets |
| **+1 week** | Second wave pitches, different angles |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Date worship** — Arbitrary dates shouldn't override smart timing
- **Friday dumps** — Only for news you don't want covered
- **Holiday ambition** — Nobody's reading on Christmas Day
- **Competitor panic** — Racing to beat them compromises quality
- **Ignoring breaking news** — Check the news before hitting send
- **One-shot thinking** — Good news can have multiple waves
- **Timezone blindness** — 6am PT is 9am ET, know your audience
- **No contingency** — Always have a backup date
