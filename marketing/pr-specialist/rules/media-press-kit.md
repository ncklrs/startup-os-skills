### Bad Executive Bio

```
✗ "John is a visionary leader passionate about innovation"
   → Empty adjectives, no substance

✗ "John has over 20 years of experience in the industry"
   → Vague, doesn't say what experience

✗ Three paragraphs of job title history
   → Resume, not bio

✗ "John enjoys hiking and spending time with family"
   → Unless relevant to their role, skip personal filler
```

### Logo and Asset Guidelines

| Asset | Formats to Provide | Guidelines |
|-------|--------------------|------------|
| **Primary logo** | SVG, PNG (light/dark bg) | Minimum size, clear space |

### Newsroom Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Keep assets current | Let headshots become outdated |
| Provide multiple formats | Force journalists to request basics |
| Make downloads easy | Require registration to access |
| Date all materials | Let undated content confuse timelines |
| Include media contact prominently | Bury contact information |
| Offer high-resolution options | Provide only low-res images |

### Updating Your Press Kit

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| New funding round | Update fact sheet, boilerplate, milestones |
| Executive hire | Add bio and headshot |
| Executive departure | Remove from press kit, archive bio |
| Major product launch | Add screenshots, update capabilities |
| Quarterly | Verify all facts, links, and images current |
| Rebrand | Replace all brand assets |

### Making Assets Journalist-Friendly

```
✓ Clear file naming
  Logo_Acme_Primary_RGB.svg
  Headshot_SarahChen_CEO_2024.jpg

✓ Multiple sizes/formats
  Logo_Acme_Primary_RGB_1000px.png
  Logo_Acme_Primary_RGB_500px.png
  Logo_Acme_Primary_CMYK.eps

✓ Easy download options
  One-click ZIP of all assets
  Individual asset downloads

✓ Clear usage guidance
  "Logo minimum size: 100px wide"
  "Please don't alter logo colors"
```

### Journalist Resource Requests

Common requests to prepare for:

| Request | Have Ready |
|---------|------------|
| "Send me your logo" | Logo package link |
| "Do you have a headshot of [exec]?" | Direct download link |
| "What's the correct name/title?" | Fact sheet with spellings |
| "Can I get product screenshots?" | Screenshot gallery link |
| "Who should I contact?" | Media contact info |
| "What's your boilerplate?" | Company overview link |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Registration walls** — Journalists won't fill out forms for assets
- **Outdated photos** — Exec from 5 years ago creates confusion
- **Missing formats** — No SVG forces bad logo reproduction
- **Hidden contact info** — Media contact should be prominent
- **PDF-only everything** — Web pages are easier to reference
- **No ZIP download** — Journalists often need multiple assets
- **Stale information** — Employee count from two years ago
- **Generic stock photos** — Use real product images
