## Thought Leadership Placement

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Thought leadership turns executives into recognized experts. It's not about promoting your company—it's about sharing insights that make people want to hear more from you.

### Thought Leadership Formats

| Format | Reach | Effort | Best For |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Bylined article** | High | High | Deep expertise, major publications |
| **Op-ed** | High | Medium-High | Timely takes, policy/industry issues |
| **Guest post** | Medium | Medium | Niche audiences, SEO value |
| **Podcast guest** | Medium | Low | Conversational experts, long-form |
| **Conference talk** | Medium | High | Networking, demos, presence |
| **Webinar** | Low-Medium | Medium | Lead generation, deep dives |
| **Newsletter feature** | Varies | Low | Targeted audiences, relationship |

### The Byline Placement Process

```
Step 1: Identify target publications
├── Where does your audience read?
├── What publications does your industry respect?
├── Who accepts contributed content?
└── What's realistic given your brand recognition?

Step 2: Find the right angle
├── What's your unique perspective?
├── What's timely or trending?
├── What will resonate with that publication's readers?
└── What can only you say (based on experience)?

Step 3: Pitch the editor
├── Subject: Clear topic, not "byline submission"
├── Hook: Why this, why now, why you?
├── Outline: What the piece will cover
├── Credentials: Why you're qualified to write this

Step 4: Write and submit
├── Follow publication guidelines exactly
├── Match their style and tone
├── Provide original value (not company promotion)
└── Be responsive to editor feedback

Step 5: Amplify after publication
├── Share across personal and company channels
├── Thank the editor publicly
├── Repurpose into social content
└── Track performance and pitch follow-ups
```

### Good Byline Topics

```
✓ "Why the Security Industry's Obsession with 'Zero Trust' Is Missing the Point"
  → Challenges conventional wisdom, offers alternative framework

✓ "I've Interviewed 200 CTOs About AI Adoption—Here's What They're Getting Wrong"
  → Original research, specific number, contrarian insight

✓ "The Hidden Cost of Technical Debt: A CFO's Perspective"
  → Unexpected angle (CFO on tech), business relevance

✓ "What the EU AI Act Actually Means for American Startups"
  → Timely, practical, specific audience
```

### Bad Byline Topics

```
✗ "Why [Your Company] Is Transforming the Industry"
  → Advertorial, will be rejected

✗ "5 Tips for Better Cybersecurity"
  → Generic, adds nothing new

✗ "The Future of AI" [by non-AI expert]
  → Off-topic, lacks credibility

✗ "How to Choose a [Your Product Category] Vendor"
  → Transparent sales pitch
```

### Thought Leadership Calendar

| **Monthly** | Podcast appearance or guest post |
| **Quarterly** | Major bylined article |
| **Semi-annual** | Conference speaking |
| **Annual** | Original research or report |

### Measuring Thought Leadership Impact

- **Company promotion in bylines** — Editors will reject, readers will tune out
- **Ghostwriting without voice** — Generic content defeats the purpose
- **Quantity over quality** — 10 weak posts < 1 strong article
- **Ignoring editor feedback** — Collaboration makes pieces better
- **Not amplifying** — Publishing without promotion wastes effort
- **Mismatched venues** — Enterprise exec writing for startup blog
- **No original insight** — Summarizing what others say
- **Inconsistent presence** — One article per year doesn't build authority
