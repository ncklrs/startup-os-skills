## PR Measurement and Metrics

**Impact: HIGH**

"You can't manage what you don't measure" applies to PR—but measuring the wrong things leads to the wrong priorities. Focus on metrics that connect to business outcomes.

### The PR Measurement Framework

| Level | Metrics | What It Tells You |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Output** | Press releases sent, pitches made | Activity (effort) |
| **Outtake** | Coverage volume, reach | Media response |
| **Outcome** | Traffic, leads, sentiment | Business impact |
| **Impact** | Revenue, brand value | Ultimate value |

### Coverage Metrics

| Metric | Definition | When It Matters |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Coverage volume** | Number of articles/mentions | Awareness campaigns |
| **Coverage quality** | Tier/reach of outlets | Brand building |
| **Share of voice** | Your mentions vs competitors | Competitive position |
| **Message pull-through** | Key messages in coverage | Message strategy |
| **Spokesperson quotes** | Exec quoted in articles | Thought leadership |
| **Sentiment** | Positive/neutral/negative tone | Reputation health |

### Coverage Quality Scoring

| Quality Factor | Score | Criteria |
|----------------|-------|----------|
| **Publication tier** | 1-5 | Tier 1 = 5, Tier 4 = 1 |
| **Article prominence** | 1-3 | Feature = 3, Mention = 1 |
| **Message inclusion** | 1-3 | All key messages = 3 |
| **Spokesperson quote** | 0-2 | Named quote = 2, No quote = 0 |
| **Sentiment** | -2 to +2 | Positive = +2, Negative = -2 |

**Coverage Quality Score** = Sum of factors × Estimated reach weight

### Good Metrics Reporting

```

├── 47 total placements (up 23% QoQ)

Share of Voice:
├── Category SOV: 34% (up from 28% in Q2)

```

### Bad Metrics Reporting

```
✗ "We got 50 pieces of coverage this quarter!"
   → Volume without quality is meaningless

✗ "Our AVE (Advertising Value Equivalency) was $5M"
   → Discredited metric, doesn't reflect actual value

✗ "We sent 200 pitches this month"
   → Activity metric, not results metric

✗ "Sentiment was 60% positive"
   → Compared to what? What drove negative?
```

### Share of Voice (SOV) Tracking

```
SOV Calculation:
Your brand mentions / Total category mentions × 100

Tracking approach:
├── Define competitive set (5-10 companies)
├── Set monitoring keywords (brand names, variations)
├── Choose time period (monthly, quarterly)
├── Filter for relevant coverage (exclude noise)
└── Calculate and trend over time

SOV by segment:
├── Overall SOV: All coverage
├── Tier 1 SOV: Top-tier publications only
├── Topic SOV: Specific themes (e.g., "AI security")
└── Geography SOV: Regional breakdown
```

### Message Pull-Through Analysis

Tracking whether coverage includes your key messages:

| Key Message | Definition | Q3 Pull-Through |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| "Zero-trust native" | References our ZT architecture | 67% |
| "Enterprise scale" | Mentions Fortune 500 or enterprise | 54% |
| "Developer-first" | Highlights developer experience | 78% |
| "Fastest deployment" | Mentions speed/time to value | 43% |

**Action:** "Fastest deployment" underperforming—prioritize in pitches.

### Sentiment Tracking

| Sentiment | Indicators | Response |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Positive** | Praise, recommendations, success stories | Amplify, repurpose |
| **Neutral** | Factual coverage, balanced reporting | Acceptable baseline |
| **Negative** | Criticism, problems, complaints | Investigate, respond |
| **Mixed** | Both positive and negative elements | Analyze what's driving each |

### Attribution: Connecting PR to Business

```
Attribution methods:

Direct attribution:
├── UTM-tagged links in coverage
├── Dedicated landing pages mentioned in articles
├── "How did you hear about us?" surveys
└── First-touch attribution in CRM

Correlation analysis:
├── Traffic spikes aligned with coverage dates
├── Brand search volume increases
├── Social mention velocity
└── Pipeline creation timing
```

| **Share of voice** | SOV vs competitors | Monthly |
| **Sentiment summary** | Positive/neutral/negative split | Weekly |
| **Message pull-through** | Key message % in coverage | Monthly |
| **Business impact** | Traffic, leads, pipeline | Monthly |
| **Activity** | Pitches sent, briefings held | Weekly |

### Tools for PR Measurement

| Category | Tools | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|

| **Social listening** | Brandwatch, Sprout Social | Sentiment, SOV |
| **Web analytics** | Google Analytics, Mixpanel | Traffic attribution |

```

### What NOT to Measure

| Vanity Metric | Why It's Misleading |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **AVE (Ad Value Equivalency)** | Discredited—editorial isn't advertising |
| **Raw impression counts** | Usually inflated, not meaningful |
| **Total potential reach** | "Could have" seen, not "did" see |
| **Pitch volume** | Activity without results |
| **Social follower counts** | Vanity without engagement context |

### Proving PR ROI

For executive reporting:

```
PR Investment: $X (team + tools + agency)

Measurable Returns:
├── [X] enterprise leads attributed to coverage
├── $[X]M pipeline influenced by PR touchpoints
├── [X]% increase in brand search volume
├── [X]% positive shift in analyst sentiment
└── [X] speaking opportunities generated

Estimated Media Value: $[X] (with caveats about methodology)

Qualitative Value:
├── Market positioning as category leader
├── Competitive differentiation in deals
├── Executive visibility and credibility
└── Recruiting advantage
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Counting clips only** — 100 low-quality mentions < 5 Tier 1 features
- **AVE obsession** — Industry has abandoned this metric
- **Ignoring negative coverage** — Hiding problems doesn't fix them
- **No baseline** — Can't show improvement without starting point
- **Activity over outcomes** — "We pitched 500 journalists" isn't success
- **Delayed reporting** — Monthly metrics should be ready within a week
- **No competitive context** — Your numbers only matter relative to market
- **Vanity dashboards** — Pretty charts that don't drive decisions
