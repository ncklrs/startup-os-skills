## Crisis Communication

**Impact: CRITICAL**

In a crisis, you have hours—not days—to shape the narrative. How you respond in the first 24 hours determines whether you recover or become a cautionary tale.

### Crisis Severity Levels

| Level | Examples | Response Time | Who Leads |
|-------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Level 1: Low** | Minor customer complaint, small factual error | 24-48 hours | PR team |
| **Level 2: Medium** | Product bug, service outage, employee incident | 4-24 hours | PR + Leadership |
| **Level 3: High** | Security breach, exec misconduct, legal action | 1-4 hours | C-suite + Legal + PR |
| **Level 4: Severe** | Death/injury, regulatory action, existential threat | Immediate | CEO + Board + Crisis team |

### The First 4 Hours

```
Hour 1: Assess
├── What happened? (facts only, no speculation)
├── Who is affected?
├── What's the current state?
├── What don't we know yet?
└── Who needs to be in the room?

Hour 2: Align
├── Brief leadership and legal
├── Determine what can be said now
├── Identify spokesperson
├── Draft initial holding statement
└── Prepare for employee communication

Hour 3: Act
├── Publish holding statement
├── Respond to journalist inquiries
├── Activate social monitoring
├── Brief customer-facing teams
└── Document everything

Hour 4: Adjust
├── Gather new information
├── Update statement if needed
├── Track coverage and sentiment
├── Plan next communication cycle
└── Begin root cause investigation
```

### The Holding Statement

When you need to respond but don't have full information:

```
Template:
"We're aware of [situation] and are actively investigating. [What you're
doing about it]. We take this seriously and will provide updates as we
learn more. [If customers affected: Here's what you should do / how to
reach us.]"

Example:
"We're aware of reports that customer data may have been accessed through
our API. We're actively investigating with our security team. We take
data security extremely seriously and will provide a full update within
24 hours. Affected customers can reach our support team at [contact] for
immediate assistance."
```

### Good Crisis Response

```
✓ "We made a mistake. Here's what happened, what we're doing to fix it,
   and how we're making sure it doesn't happen again."
   → Takes responsibility, shows action, commits to change

✓ "We're aware and investigating. We don't have all the facts yet, but
   we'll share what we learn within [timeframe]."
   → Honest about uncertainty, commits to timeline

✓ "To our customers: [Specific apology]. Here's exactly what this means
   for you and what we're doing about it."
   → Addresses affected parties directly
```

### Bad Crisis Response

```
✗ "We can neither confirm nor deny..."
   → Sounds like you're hiding something

✗ "This was an isolated incident"
   → Minimizing before you know the full scope

✗ "We take privacy seriously" [with no specifics]
   → Empty phrase that means nothing

✗ Complete silence hoping it blows over
   → Vacuum fills with speculation

✗ "Our lawyers advised us not to comment"
   → You just commented, and badly

✗ Blaming the victim/customer
   → Never, ever do this
```

### Crisis Communication Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Speed beats perfection** | A good statement now beats a perfect one tomorrow |
| **Own the narrative** | You tell the story, or someone else will |
| **Transparency builds trust** | Admit what you know and don't know |
| **Actions over words** | What you do matters more than what you say |
| **One voice** | Designate spokesperson, align all communications |
| **Think long-term** | How will this response look in 6 months? |

### Statement Structure

| Section | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Acknowledgment** | Show you're aware | "We're aware that..." |
| **Facts** | What happened (confirmed only) | "On [date], [specific event]" |
| **Impact** | Who's affected, how | "[X] customers may be impacted" |
| **Response** | What you're doing | "We've [actions taken]" |
| **Commitment** | What happens next | "We will [future actions]" |
| **Resources** | How to get help/info | "Contact [support] or visit [page]" |

### Spokesperson Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Speak in first person ("we") | Deflect to "they" or "the company" |
| Acknowledge the human impact | Focus only on business impact |
| Stay calm and measured | Get defensive or emotional |
| Say "I don't know yet" if true | Speculate or guess |
| Commit to follow-up timing | Make promises you can't keep |
| Prepare for tough questions | Wing it |

### Media Inquiry Response Matrix

| Inquiry Type | Response Approach |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Breaking news** | Holding statement, promise timeline |
| **Follow-up questions** | Answer what you can, "investigating" for rest |
| **Requests for interview** | CEO for Level 3-4, spokesperson for 1-2 |
| **Hostile/gotcha** | Stick to facts, don't take bait |
| **Background request** | Help journalists understand context |

### Internal vs External Communication

| Audience | Timing | Content |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Employees** | Before or same time as external | Full context, what to say if asked |
| **Customers** | Immediately if affected | Impact, what to do, how to reach you |
| **Media** | Within hours | Statement, spokesperson availability |
| **Investors** | Same day for material issues | Business impact, response plan |
| **Partners** | Same day | How it affects them, what you're doing |

### Social Media During Crisis

| Platform | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **Twitter/X** | Monitor constantly, respond to direct questions |
| **LinkedIn** | Post official statement, limit engagement |
| **Comments** | Acknowledge, don't argue, point to official statement |
| **DMs** | Route to official channels |

### Crisis Timeline Template

```
T+0: Incident occurs
├── T+30min: Internal alert, war room assembled
├── T+1hr: Leadership briefed, initial assessment
├── T+2hr: Holding statement published
├── T+4hr: First detailed update (if available)
├── T+24hr: Full statement with root cause (if known)
├── T+48hr: Remediation update
├── T+1wk: Post-mortem or detailed report
└── T+30d: Review and process improvements
```

### Post-Crisis Actions

| Timeframe | Actions |
|-----------|---------|
| **Week 1** | Full post-mortem, document learnings |
| **Week 2-4** | Implement immediate changes, update processes |
| **Month 2-3** | Rebuild affected relationships, proactive outreach |
| **Month 6** | Audit changes, assess reputation recovery |

### Crisis Preparedness Checklist

Before a crisis happens:

- [ ] Crisis communication plan documented
- [ ] Spokesperson trained on media interviews
- [ ] Holding statement templates ready
- [ ] Escalation matrix defined
- [ ] Legal review process established
- [ ] Social monitoring tools active
- [ ] Employee communication channels tested
- [ ] Key journalist relationships maintained
- [ ] Dark site or status page ready to activate

### Anti-Patterns

- **No comment** — Always reads as guilty
- **Deleting evidence** — Screenshots exist, it will get worse
- **Blame shifting** — "The vendor" or "a rogue employee"
- **Lawyer-speak** — Legal CYA language sounds evasive
- **Over-promising** — "This will never happen again"
- **Under-communicating** — One statement, then silence
- **Defensive posture** — Treating journalists as enemies
- **Declaring victory early** — "Crisis is over" while it's ongoing
- **Forgetting stakeholders** — Employees learn from news
- **No post-mortem** — Missing the learning opportunity
