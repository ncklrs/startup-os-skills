# Website Copy Specialist

Expert website copywriter specializing in SaaS and B2B website pages — from homepage messaging to conversion-focused CTAs across every page type.

## Philosophy

Great website copy does four things:

1. **Answers "What is this?"** — Visitors decide in 3-5 seconds if they're in the right place
2. **Creates a clear path** — Every page guides toward one primary action
3. **Speaks to the visitor** — "You" language, not "we" language
4. **Reduces friction** — Anticipates objections and addresses them proactively

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `homepage-*` — Homepage messaging hierarchy and structure
- `feature-*` — Feature page copy and organization
- `about-*` — About page storytelling
- `pricing-*` — Pricing page copy optimization
- `comparison-*` — Comparison and alternative pages
- `tour-*` — Product tour pages
- `integration-*` — Integration pages
- `usecase-*` — Use case and solution pages
- `conversion-*` — Demo request and contact pages
- `navigation-*` — Navigation and microcopy

## Core Frameworks

### The Clarity Hierarchy

Every page follows the same priority:

```
1. WHAT (What is this thing?)
   ↓
2. WHO (Is this for me?)
   ↓
3. WHY (Why should I care?)
   ↓
4. HOW (How does it work?)
   ↓
5. PROOF (Can I trust this?)
   ↓
6. ACTION (What do I do next?)
```

### Message-Market Match

| Audience Awareness | What They Need | Copy Approach |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Unaware** | Education on the problem | Lead with pain/problem |
| **Problem-aware** | Understanding of solutions | Agitate + introduce solution |
| **Solution-aware** | Why your solution | Differentiation + benefits |
| **Product-aware** | Confidence to buy | Proof + urgency + offer |
| **Most aware** | Easy path to action | CTA + friction removal |

### Page Types and Goals

| Page Type | Primary Goal | Secondary Goal |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Homepage** | Communicate value prop | Route to relevant content |
| **Feature page** | Demonstrate capability | Drive trial/demo |
| **About page** | Build trust and credibility | Attract talent |
| **Pricing page** | Enable purchase decision | Qualify leads |
| **Comparison page** | Win competitive deals | Capture switch intent |
| **Product tour** | Visualize the experience | Reduce demo friction |
| **Integration page** | Show ecosystem fit | Capture integration searches |
| **Use case page** | Prove relevance to segment | Capture intent by persona |
| **Demo/Contact** | Convert to conversation | Qualify the lead |

### The Specificity Ladder

More specific = more persuasive:

```
Weak:    "Save time"
Better:  "Save hours every week"
Strong:  "Save 5 hours per week"
Best:    "Save 5 hours per week on code reviews"
```

## Website Copy Spectrum

| Page | Tone | Focus | Primary CTA |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Homepage** | Confident, clear | Value + differentiation | Start trial / See demo |
| **Features** | Educational, demonstrative | Capabilities + outcomes | Try feature / Learn more |
| **About** | Human, authentic | Story + mission + team | Join us / Contact |
| **Pricing** | Transparent, helpful | Value per tier | Start trial / Talk to sales |
| **Comparison** | Confident, factual | Differences + advantages | Switch now / Try free |
| **Product tour** | Visual, guided | Experience preview | Start free |
| **Integration** | Technical, practical | Setup + benefits | Connect now |
| **Use case** | Relatable, solution-focused | Problem + proof | See how |
| **Demo/Contact** | Helpful, low-pressure | Value of conversation | Book time |

## Content Hierarchy by Page

### Homepage Sections (Order)
1. Hero (value prop + CTA)
2. Social proof bar (logos)
3. Problem/solution overview
4. Key features/benefits
5. How it works
6. Testimonials/case studies
7. Secondary features
8. Final CTA

### Feature Page Sections
1. Feature headline + subhead
2. Hero visual (screenshot/video)
3. Key benefits (3-5)
4. Detailed capabilities
5. Use cases
6. Social proof
7. Related features
8. CTA

## Anti-Patterns

- **"We" focused copy** — "We built" vs "You get"
- **Feature lists without benefits** — Features tell, benefits sell
- **Generic headlines** — "Welcome to [Company]" tells nothing
- **Buried CTAs** — Make the action obvious and repeated
- **Missing social proof** — Claims without evidence
- **One-size-fits-all** — Different pages need different voices
- **Jargon overload** — Write for humans, not search engines
- **No clear hierarchy** — Visitors scan, they don't read
- **Competing CTAs** — One primary action per page
- **Ignoring objections** — Address concerns before they derail
