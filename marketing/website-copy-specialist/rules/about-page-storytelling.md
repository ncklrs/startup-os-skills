## About Page Storytelling

**Impact: HIGH**

The about page builds trust and connection. It answers: "Who is behind this product, and can I trust them?" Done well, it turns evaluators into believers.

### The Three Audiences

Your about page serves three different readers:

| Audience | What They Want | What to Emphasize |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Potential customers** | Trust, credibility | Experience, stability, customer focus |
| **Potential hires** | Culture, mission | Values, team, growth opportunity |
| **Partners/investors** | Vision, traction | Market insight, momentum, leadership |

### Opening Statement Formulas

| Formula | Example | Tone |
|---------|---------|------|
| **We [belief statement]** | "We believe software should be invisible" | Mission-driven |
| **[Company] [does X]** | "Acme builds tools that get out of the way" | Direct |
| **[Bold claim]** | "The best work happens when tools disappear" | Confident |
| **[Question]** | "Why does business software hate its users?" | Provocative |

### Good Opening Statements

```
✓ "We believe the best infrastructure is the kind you never think about."
  → Clear belief, implies their approach

✓ "Great products come from teams that talk to their customers."
  → Values-driven, customer-centric

✓ "We're building the financial tools we wished existed."
  → Origin hint, relatable motivation

✓ "Enterprise software should be as good as consumer software.
   That's why we exist."
  → Problem → Mission in two sentences
```

### Bad Opening Statements

```
✗ "Welcome to our about page! We're so glad you're here."
  → Wastes prime real estate

✗ "Founded in 2019, Acme Inc. is a leading provider of..."
  → Boring, could be any company

✗ "Our mission is to leverage synergies to drive innovation."
  → Meaningless corporate speak

✗ "We're passionate about helping businesses succeed."
  → Generic, could describe anyone
```

### Origin Story Framework

The best origin stories follow this arc:

```
1. THE PROBLEM (Conflict)
   "We were [doing X] when we realized [Y was broken]"

2. THE INSIGHT (Turning point)
   "We discovered that [unexpected truth]"

3. THE SOLUTION (Resolution)
   "So we built [product] to [solve problem]"

4. THE MISSION (Forward look)
   "Now we're on a mission to [bigger vision]"
```

### Good Origin Story

```
✓ "In 2019, we were a team of four engineers building a fintech product.
   Every week, we'd waste hours hunting for API keys scattered across
   Slack, .env files, and sticky notes.

   When a leaked credential almost cost us a launch, we knew something
   had to change. We looked for a solution that was secure, simple,
   and didn't require a PhD in DevOps. It didn't exist.

   So we built SecretStash. What started as an internal tool now helps
   10,000+ teams ship faster without compromising security.

   We're just getting started."
```

### Bad Origin Story

```
✗ "Acme was founded by three Harvard Business School graduates who
   identified a gap in the market for enterprise SaaS solutions.
   After extensive market research and strategic planning, they
   secured $5M in seed funding and began building the platform."
   → No emotion, no problem, sounds like a press release
```

### Mission vs. Vision

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Mission** | What you do and why | "Make developer tools that ship with confidence" |
| **Vision** | The future you're creating | "A world where every developer can deploy without fear" |

### Good Mission Statements

```
✓ "We exist to make security invisible."
  → Clear, specific, memorable

✓ "Help teams do their best work, faster."
  → Outcome-focused, concise

✓ "Give every startup enterprise-grade tools."
  → Specific audience, clear value
```

### Bad Mission Statements

```
✗ "To be the world's leading provider of innovative solutions"
  → Generic, unmemorable, vague

✗ "Empowering businesses to achieve digital transformation"
  → Buzzword soup

✗ "Making the world a better place through technology"
  → Grandiose, unclear
```

### Writing Meaningful Values

For each value, provide:
1. **The value name** (2-3 words)
2. **What it means in practice** (1-2 sentences)
3. **How you actually live it** (optional example)

### Good Values Section

```
✓ "Default to transparency"
   We share context, not just conclusions. Everyone at the company
   can see our board decks, financials, and strategic plans.

✓ "Ship, then iterate"
   Progress beats perfection. We'd rather ship something good today
   and improve it tomorrow than wait for something perfect.

✓ "Talk to users weekly"
   Everyone — engineers, designers, founders — talks to customers
   at least once a week. It's how we stay grounded.
```

### Bad Values Section

```
✗ "Innovation"
   We are innovative.
   → No meaning, no evidence

✗ "Excellence"
   We strive for excellence in everything we do.
   → Generic, could be any company

✗ "Integrity"
   We operate with the highest integrity.
   → Baseline expectation, not differentiating
```

### Team Section Best Practices

| Element | Do | Don't |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Photos** | Consistent style, approachable | Stock photos, inconsistent sizes |
| **Names** | Full name, role | Just first names (unclear) |
| **Bios** | 2-3 sentences, personality | Multi-paragraph resumes |
| **Links** | LinkedIn, Twitter if active | Every social platform |
| **Order** | Leadership first, then team | Random order |

### Good Team Bios

```
✓ "Sarah Chen, CEO"
   Sarah spent 10 years building infrastructure at Stripe before
   starting Acme. She's obsessed with developer experience and
   terrible at making sourdough.

✓ "Marcus Johnson, Head of Engineering"
   Former Staff Engineer at Notion. Believes the best code is the
   code you delete. Runs ultramarathons for reasons he can't explain.
```

### Bad Team Bios

```
✗ "John Smith is a visionary leader with 20+ years of experience
   driving strategic initiatives across Fortune 500 companies.
   He holds an MBA from Wharton and a BS in Computer Science
   from MIT. Prior to Acme, John was Senior Vice President of
   Strategic Operations at..."
   → Resume, not personality

✗ "CEO"
   [Just a photo and title, no bio]
   → Missed opportunity to build connection
```

### Traction Section Options

| Metric Type | Example | Best For |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Customer logos** | "Trusted by teams at..." | Enterprise/B2B |
| **User count** | "50,000+ developers" | Broad adoption |
| **Revenue/growth** | "$10M ARR" | Investor/partner audiences |
| **Funding** | "Backed by Sequoia, a16z" | Credibility signal |
| **Milestones** | "2M+ deploys processed" | Usage-based products |

### About Page CTAs

| Primary Goal | Primary CTA | Secondary CTA |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Recruiting focus** | "See open roles" | "Learn about our culture" |
| **Customer focus** | "Start free trial" | "Contact us" |
| **Balanced** | "Join us" | "Try the product" |

### About Page Checklist

- [ ] Opening statement is specific to your company
- [ ] Origin story shows the problem you saw
- [ ] Mission is clear and memorable
- [ ] Values are specific and backed by examples
- [ ] Team photos are consistent and approachable
- [ ] Bios show personality, not just credentials
- [ ] Traction/proof section builds credibility

- [ ] Page serves both customers and candidates

### Anti-Patterns

- **"We" overload** — About pages can use "we," but balance with "you"
- **Corporate speak** — "Synergize solutions" isn't human
- **Resume culture** — People connect with stories, not credentials
- **Missing humanity** — Show the people, not just the product
- **Generic values** — "Innovation, Excellence, Integrity" = nothing
- **Stock team photos** — Use real photos of real people
- **No origin story** — Every company has a "why"
- **Purely promotional** — It's an about page, not a sales page
- **Outdated info** — Wrong team members, old funding rounds
