## Win-Back Campaigns

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

It's 5x cheaper to retain a customer than acquire a new one—and winning back churned customers is often cheaper than both. A good win-back program can recover 5-15% of churned customers.

### The Win-Back Timeline

```
CHURNED → WARM (0-30 days) → COOLING (31-90 days) → COLD (90+ days)
              ↓                     ↓                     ↓
         High success          Medium success        Low success
         Personalized          Value refresh         Major change
```

### Win-Back Windows

| Window | Success Rate | Strategy |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **0-7 days** | 10-25% | Immediate save, remorse capture |
| **8-30 days** | 5-15% | Address churn reason, offer |
| **31-60 days** | 3-8% | New value, what's changed |
| **61-90 days** | 2-5% | Major announcement, special offer |
| **90+ days** | 1-3% | Relationship, not transaction |

### Win-Back by Churn Reason

| Reason | Win-Back Message | Offer Type |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **Price/budget** | "We've got new options" | Discount, annual deal, lower tier |
| **Missing feature** | "We built what you asked for" | Feature announcement |
| **Poor experience** | "We've improved since you left" | Apology + what's new |
| **Competitor** | "Here's why customers come back" | Comparison, case study |
| **Didn't use enough** | "Get started in 5 minutes" | Free trial, onboarding help |
| **Changed needs** | "When you're ready again" | Stay in touch |
| **Company closed** | N/A | Remove from list |

### Good Win-Back Campaigns

```
✓ Personalized to churn reason
  → Address WHY they left specifically
  → Not generic "come back" message

✓ Show what's changed
  → New features, improvements, team
  → Reason to reconsider

✓ Low-friction return
  → One-click reactivate
  → Data still there

✓ Time-limited offer
  → Creates urgency without pressure
  → "This month only" not "limited time"

✓ Multiple channels
  → Email + retargeting + personal outreach
  → Reach them where they are
```

### Bad Win-Back Campaigns

```
✗ Generic "we miss you"
  → Doesn't address why they left

✗ Immediately after churn
  → Feels desperate
  → Wait 7+ days (unless remorse campaign)

✗ No offer or reason
  → "Come back" without why

✗ Aggressive frequency
  → Daily emails after they left
  → Confirm why they're gone

✗ Ignoring churn reason
  → They left for price, you pitch features

✗ No data retention messaging
  → "Your projects are waiting" is powerful
```

| 45 | "Customer spotlight" | Social proof, success |
| 60 | "Major update" | Big news, reason to return |
