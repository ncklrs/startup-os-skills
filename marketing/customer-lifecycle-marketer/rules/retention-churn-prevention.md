## Retention & Churn Prevention

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Reducing churn by 5% can increase profits by 25-95%. By the time a customer cancels, it's usually too late. Proactive retention is the only sustainable strategy.

### The Churn Lifecycle

```
HEALTHY → AT-RISK → DECLINING → CHURNING → CHURNED
   ↓          ↓         ↓           ↓          ↓
 Monitor   Intervene  Escalate    Save     Win-back
```

### Churn Types

| Type | Definition | Prevention |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Voluntary** | Customer chooses to leave | Value delivery, engagement |
| **Involuntary** | Payment failure | Dunning, card updates |
| **Controllable** | Within your influence | Product, support, success |
| **Uncontrollable** | Business closed, acquired | Minimize, don't obsess |

### Early Warning Signals

| Signal | Risk Level | Detection Method |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Login frequency declining | Medium | Product analytics |
| Support tickets increasing | Medium | Support data |
| Feature usage dropping | High | Usage analytics |
| Key user churned | High | User tracking |
| Missed renewal meeting | High | CS activity |
| Negative NPS/feedback | High | Survey responses |
| Contract downgrades | Very High | Billing data |
| Cancellation page visited | Critical | Event tracking |

### Customer Health Score

| Component | Weight | Metrics |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Product engagement** | 30% | DAU/MAU, feature adoption, depth |
| **Relationship** | 25% | CSM engagement, exec sponsor |
| **Support** | 15% | Ticket volume, sentiment, resolution |
| **Growth signals** | 15% | User adds, usage expansion |
| **Financial** | 15% | Payment history, contract value |

### Health Score Thresholds

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 80-100 | Healthy | Expansion focus |
| 60-79 | Stable | Monitor, optimize |
| 40-59 | At-risk | Proactive intervention |
| 20-39 | Critical | Executive escalation |
| 0-19 | Emergency | All-hands save attempt |

### Good Retention Practices

```
✓ Proactive health monitoring
  → Weekly health score reviews
  → Automated alerts for declining accounts

✓ Multi-threaded relationships
  → Know multiple stakeholders, not just one
  → Champion leaves ≠ automatic churn

✓ Consistent value delivery
  → Regular business reviews
  → Success milestone tracking

✓ Fast support response
  → Frustrated customers leave
  → Priority for at-risk accounts

✓ Product stickiness
  → Integrations, data, workflows
  → High switching cost (ethical)
```

### Bad Retention Practices

```
✗ Reactive-only retention
  → Waiting for cancellation request

✗ Single point of contact
  → Champion leaves, relationship dies

✗ Ignoring declining usage
  → "They're still paying" isn't health

✗ Discounting to save
  → Delays churn, doesn't fix problem

✗ Annual contracts as crutch
  → Locks in unhappy customers temporarily

✗ No cancellation analysis
  → Same problems repeat
```

### At-Risk Intervention Playbook

| Stage | Timeline | Actions |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Early warning** | Score drops 10+ points | CSM check-in, usage review |
| **At-risk** | Score <60 | Exec involvement, success plan |
| **Critical** | Score <40, cancel signals | Save call, leadership escalation |
| **Pre-churn** | Cancel request received | Save offer, exit interview |
| **Post-churn** | After cancellation | Exit analysis, win-back plan |

### Save Offer Hierarchy

Only use when value-based intervention fails:

| Offer | When to Use | Risk |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Extended trial/access | Need more time to see value | Low |
| Free training/onboarding | Adoption issues | Low |
| Temporary discount | Budget concerns, proven value | Medium |
| Contract pause | Timing issues | Medium |
| Downgrade option | Needs don't match plan | High (revenue) |
| Refund/exit | Unsaveable, goodwill | High (revenue) |

### Cancellation Flow Best Practices

```
✓ Understand before offering saves
  → "Can you tell me what's not working?"
  → Segmented save offers based on reason

✓ Make it easy (ethically)
  → Difficult cancellation = angry churn
  → Easy cancellation = potential return

✓ Offer alternatives
  → Downgrade, pause, reduced billing
  → "Would [alternative] work better?"

✓ Exit interview
  → Learn from every churn
  → Feed back to product/success

✓ Leave door open
  → "We'd love to have you back"
  → Win-back campaign eligibility
```

### Involuntary Churn (Failed Payments)

| Day | Action | Channel |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 0 | Payment failed notification | Email |
| 1 | Retry payment | Automatic |
| 3 | Update card reminder | Email + In-app |
| 5 | Second retry | Automatic |
| 7 | Urgent: service at risk | Email + SMS |
| 10 | Final warning | Email + In-app |
| 14 | Account suspended (not deleted) | Email |
| 30 | Final notice before deletion | Email |

### Retention Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Gross Retention** | Retained MRR / Starting MRR | 85-95% |
| **Net Retention** | (Retained + Expansion) / Starting | 100-130% |
| **Logo Churn** | Churned Customers / Total | <5% monthly |
| **Revenue Churn** | Churned MRR / Total MRR | <2% monthly |
| **Resurrection Rate** | Win-backs / Churned | 5-15% |

### Churn Analysis Framework

For every churned account, document:

```
## Churn Analysis: [Account Name]

**Churn Date:** [Date]
**MRR Lost:** [Amount]
**Tenure:** [Months]

**Primary Reason:**

□ Budget/cost
□ Champion left
□ Competitor
□ Business closed
□ Other: ___

**Secondary Factors:**
- [Factor 1]
- [Factor 2]

**Warning Signs Missed:**
- [Signal 1]
- [Signal 2]

**Preventable?** Yes / No / Maybe

**Lessons Learned:**
- [Learning 1]
- [Learning 2]

**Action Items:**
- [ ] [Improvement for future]
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Discount-first saves** — Trains customers to threaten churn
- **Ignoring health scores** — Data without action is useless
- **Annual contracts as "retention"** — Defers churn, doesn't prevent it
- **No post-churn analysis** — Same mistakes repeated
- **Treating all churn equally** — Segment by reason and value
- **Dark patterns in cancellation** — Damages brand, increases anger
- **Letting champions leave silently** — Should trigger immediate action
