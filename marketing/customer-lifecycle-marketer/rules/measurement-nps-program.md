## NPS Program Design

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

NPS is only valuable if it drives action. The score itself is less important than what you do with the feedback.

### NPS Fundamentals

```
On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend [Product] to a friend or colleague?

Detractors: 0-6    Passives: 7-8    Promoters: 9-10

NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors

Range: -100 to +100
```

### NPS Benchmarks by Industry

| Industry | Average | Good | Excellent |
|----------|---------|------|-----------|
| **SaaS** | 30 | 40-50 | 60+ |
| **Consumer Tech** | 40 | 50-60 | 70+ |
| **E-commerce** | 45 | 55-65 | 75+ |
| **B2B Services** | 35 | 45-55 | 65+ |
| **Financial** | 35 | 45-55 | 65+ |

### NPS Survey Types

| Type | Timing | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Relationship NPS** | Regular cadence (quarterly) | Overall health |
| **Transactional NPS** | After key interactions | Experience quality |
| **Post-onboarding NPS** | 30-60 days after start | Onboarding success |
| **Post-support NPS** | After ticket resolved | Support quality |
| **Pre-renewal NPS** | 60-90 days before renewal | Churn prediction |

### Good NPS Program

```
✓ Consistent timing
  → Same cadence, same segment targeting
  → Trends meaningful over time

✓ Follow-up question
  → "What's the primary reason for your score?"
  → Qualitative > quantitative

✓ Closed-loop process
  → Every detractor gets outreach
  → Every promoter gets advocacy ask

✓ Action on feedback
  → Track themes, fix issues
  → Show customers you listened

✓ Segmented analysis
  → By plan, tenure, usage, industry
  → Aggregate hides insights
```

### Bad NPS Program

```
✗ Survey without action
  → Collect scores, do nothing
  → Wastes customer time, damages trust

✗ Gaming the survey
  → "Please rate us a 10"
  → Biased data, useless insights

✗ Too frequent
  → Monthly NPS = survey fatigue
  → Quarterly is typical

✗ Only tracking score
  → Number without context
  → Feedback themes matter more

✗ No segmentation
  → All customers averaged
  → Miss high-value issues
```

### NPS Survey Flow

```
Step 1: Score
"How likely are you to recommend [Product] to a colleague?"
[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]

Step 2: Reason (required)
"What's the primary reason for your score?"
[Open text field]

Step 3: Follow-up (optional, based on score)
Promoter: "Would you be open to sharing your experience?"
Passive: "What would make you a 10?"
Detractor: "What could we do better?"

Step 4: Thank you
"Thank you for your feedback. We read every response."
```

### Closed-Loop Response Framework

| Score | Timeline | Owner | Action |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| **0-6** | 24-48 hours | CSM + Manager | Personal call, issue resolution |
| **7-8** | 1 week | CSM | Email follow-up, improvement plan |
| **9-10** | 1 week | CSM or Marketing | Thank you + advocacy ask |

- **Gaming scores** — "Please give us a 10"
- **Vanity metric** — Track score, ignore feedback
- **No segmentation** — Average hides problems
- **No action loop** — Collect data, change nothing
- **One-time survey** — Need trends, not snapshots
