## Expansion & Upsell Strategy

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Expansion revenue is the engine of sustainable SaaS growth. Companies with >100% net revenue retention grow 2-3x faster than those relying on new logos alone.

### Expansion Revenue Types

| Type | Definition | Example | Typical Lift |
|------|------------|---------|--------------|
| **Upsell** | Higher tier of same product | Basic → Pro | 50-200% |
| **Cross-sell** | Additional products | Add analytics module | 20-50% |
| **Seat expansion** | More users on account | 5 → 25 seats | Variable |
| **Usage expansion** | Increased consumption | More API calls | 10-50% |
| **Price increase** | Raise existing prices | Annual adjustment | 5-15% |

### The Expansion Flywheel

```
         ┌──────────────┐
         │    VALUE     │
         │  DELIVERED   │
         └──────┬───────┘
                │
                ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│                                   │
│  ADOPTION ──────▶ EXPANSION ─────▶│
│      ▲                    │       │
│      │                    │       │
│      └────── SUCCESS ◀────┘       │
│                                   │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Expansion Timing Signals

| Signal | Expansion Type | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Hitting usage limits | Usage upsell | Proactive outreach |
| Team growth (new users) | Seat expansion | Invite flow optimization |
| Feature requests for premium | Feature upsell | Demo premium capability |
| Multiple use cases | Cross-sell | Solution consultation |
| Power user behavior | Champion for expansion | Enablement + advocacy |
| Contract renewal approaching | All types | Expansion conversation |

### Good Expansion Practices

```
✓ Value-first timing
  → Expand after customer success, not before
  → "You've achieved X, here's how to get more"

✓ Natural usage triggers
  → "You're at 80% of your plan limit"
  → "Your team has grown — need more seats?"

✓ Champion enablement
  → Arm internal advocates with business case
  → Make them look good to their leadership

✓ Bundled value
  → Package expansion with additional services
  → Training, support, implementation included

✓ Frictionless upgrade
  → Self-serve when possible
  → One-click plan changes
```

### Bad Expansion Practices

```
✗ Selling during onboarding
  → Customer hasn't realized value yet

✗ Hard limits without warning
  → Surprise blocks damage relationship

✗ Expansion-focused CSM metrics only
  → Damages trust if too salesy

✗ Ignoring usage patterns
  → Pushing features they don't need

✗ Forced annual upsell conversations
  → Feels transactional, not consultative

✗ No self-serve option
  → Friction for small expansions
```

### Pricing Levers for Expansion

| Lever | Strategy | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Usage-based** | Charge by consumption | API calls, storage, seats |
| **Feature gates** | Premium features on higher tiers | Advanced analytics, SSO |
| **Support tiers** | Better support = higher price | 24/7, dedicated CSM |
| **Limits** | Soft/hard caps drive upgrades | 5 projects on Basic |
| **Add-ons** | À la carte capabilities | Integrations, modules |

### Expansion Conversation Framework

```
1. DISCOVERY
   "How has [Product] been working for you?"
   "What are you trying to accomplish this quarter?"

2. VALUE CONFIRMATION
   "It sounds like [Product] has helped you with X..."
   "Your team has seen [specific results]..."

3. GAP IDENTIFICATION
   "Are there areas where you'd like to do more?"
   "What's preventing you from [bigger goal]?"

4. SOLUTION MAPPING
   "Here's how [expansion option] could help..."
   "Other customers in your situation have..."

5. BUSINESS CASE
   "The ROI typically looks like..."
   "Given your [usage/growth], the investment is..."

6. NEXT STEPS
   "Want me to set up a trial of [feature]?"
   "I can send over a proposal for..."
```

### Self-Serve Expansion Tactics

| Tactic | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Usage alerts** | "You're at 80% of your limit" emails |
| **In-app prompts** | Contextual upgrade offers at limit |
| **Feature gates** | "Upgrade to access" with preview |
| **Comparison pages** | Clear tier differentiation |
| **Trial of premium** | Limited-time feature access |
| **Annual discount** | Incentive to commit longer |

### Expansion Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Net Revenue Retention** | (Start MRR + Expansion - Churn) / Start MRR | 110-130% |
| **Expansion MRR** | New MRR from existing customers | Growing MoM |
| **Expansion Rate** | Expansion MRR / Total MRR | 3-5% monthly |
| **Upsell Conversion** | Upgraded / Eligible | 15-25% |
| **Time to Expansion** | Days from start to first expansion | <180 days |

### Account Segmentation for Expansion

| Segment | Expansion Focus | Approach |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| **Enterprise** | Custom solutions, multi-year | High-touch, consultative |
| **Mid-market** | Tier upgrades, seats | Hybrid touch |
| **SMB** | Self-serve upgrades, add-ons | Product-led, automated |
| **Usage-heavy** | Usage tiers | Proactive before limits |
| **Underutilized** | Adoption first, then expansion | Success focus first |

### Expansion Playbook by Trigger

| Trigger | Playbook |
|---------|----------|
| Usage at 80% | Email alert → In-app prompt → CSM outreach if no action |
| New team members added | Seat expansion email → Team plan comparison |
| Feature request submitted | Premium feature demo → Trial offer |
| Positive NPS/review | Advocate program invite → Expansion conversation |
| Contract 60 days from renewal | Renewal + expansion discussion |
| Major customer milestone | Celebration → "What's next?" conversation |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Expanding unhealthy accounts** — Fix adoption issues first
- **One-size-fits-all pitches** — Personalize to their situation
- **CSM as salesperson** — Damages trusted advisor relationship
- **Ignoring small expansions** — Seat adds compound significantly
- **No expansion in product** — Relying only on human outreach
- **Surprise price increases** — Communicate value before price
- **Forcing annual at renewal** — Offer, don't require
