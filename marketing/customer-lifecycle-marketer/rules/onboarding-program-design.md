## Onboarding Program Design

**Impact: CRITICAL**

The first 30 days determine whether a customer becomes a long-term advocate or a churn statistic. 40-60% of users who sign up for a free trial use the product once and never return.

### The Onboarding Timeline

```
Day 0-1:   Welcome + First Value
Day 2-7:   Core Feature Adoption
Day 8-14:  Habit Formation
Day 15-30: Expansion + Integration
Day 30+:   Ongoing Engagement
```

### Onboarding Goals by Phase

| Phase | Goal | Success Metric |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Immediate** (0-24h) | First "aha" moment | Completed key action |
| **Short-term** (1-7 days) | Core workflow established | 3+ sessions |
| **Medium-term** (7-30 days) | Habit formation | Weekly active use |
| **Long-term** (30+ days) | Full value realization | Feature adoption score |

### The "Aha Moment" Framework

Identify and accelerate the moment users experience core value:

| Product Type | Typical Aha Moment | Time Target |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Analytics** | First insight from their data | <1 hour |
| **Productivity** | First task completed | <10 minutes |
| **Communication** | First message sent/received | <5 minutes |
| **Developer tools** | First successful API call | <30 minutes |
| **CRM** | First contact imported | <15 minutes |

### Onboarding Channels

| Channel | Best For | Timing |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **In-app guidance** | Feature discovery, workflows | Real-time |
| **Email sequence** | Education, motivation, re-engagement | Days 1-30 |
| **Video tutorials** | Complex features, visual learners | On-demand |
| **Live webinars** | High-touch, Q&A | Weekly |
| **1:1 calls** | Enterprise, high-value accounts | By request |
| **Chat/support** | Stuck users, quick questions | Real-time |

### Good Onboarding Design

```
✓ Progressive disclosure
  → Show only what's needed at each step
  → Advanced features revealed after basics mastered

✓ Quick wins first
  → Immediate value before asking for effort
  → "See what's possible" before "set everything up"

✓ Clear progress indicators
  → Checklist showing completion status
  → Celebration at milestones

✓ Multiple learning paths
  → Video for visual learners
  → Docs for self-service
  → Human help for complex needs

✓ Personalized by use case
  → Different flows for different user types
  → "What's your main goal?" drives experience
```

### Bad Onboarding Design

```
✗ Feature dump on first login
  → Overwhelming, increases abandonment

✗ Mandatory multi-step setup
  → Value delayed, friction increased

✗ Generic welcome email
  → Missed opportunity for personalization

✗ No progress tracking
  → Users don't know what's next

✗ One path for all users
  → Different personas have different needs

✗ Setup before value
  → "Invite your team" before solo user sees value
```

### Email Onboarding Sequence

| Day | Email | Goal |
|-----|-------|------|
| 0 | Welcome + quick start | First login |
| 1 | Key feature highlight | Core action |
| 3 | Use case inspiration | Expand usage |
| 5 | Integration/team | Deeper adoption |
| 7 | Check-in + help offer | Re-engage or assist |
| 10 | Success story | Social proof |
| 14 | Feature spotlight | Expand value |
| 21 | Feedback request | Learn + engage |
| 28 | Upgrade/next steps | Conversion |

### Activation Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Benchmark |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Signup to first action** | Time to complete key action | <24 hours |
| **Activation rate** | % completing activation criteria | 40-60% |
| **Onboarding completion** | % finishing onboarding flow | 60-80% |
| **Day 1 retention** | % returning after day 1 | 25-40% |
| **Day 7 retention** | % active on day 7 | 15-25% |
| **Day 30 retention** | % active on day 30 | 10-20% |

### Intervention Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| No login after 24h | Email: "Need help getting started?" |
| Started but didn't finish key action | In-app: Resume prompt |
| 3 days inactive | Email: Value reminder + help offer |
| 7 days inactive | Email: Personalized re-engagement |
| Support ticket during onboarding | Priority response + check-in |
| Completed onboarding | Celebration + next steps |

### Personalization Opportunities

| Signal | Personalization |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Role/title** | Relevant use cases and examples |
| **Company size** | Appropriate feature recommendations |
| **Industry** | Industry-specific templates/content |
| **Referral source** | Acknowledge how they found you |
| **Use case selected** | Tailored onboarding path |
| **Behavior** | Dynamic next-best-action |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Email-only onboarding** — In-app guidance needed for activation
- **One-size-fits-all** — Different users need different paths
- **Feature tours that block** — Let users explore, guide gently
- **No success celebration** — Miss opportunity to build momentum
- **Asking for too much upfront** — Earn trust before asking for data
- **Ignoring drop-offs** — No intervention for stuck users
- **Setup before value** — Show value first, then ask for setup
