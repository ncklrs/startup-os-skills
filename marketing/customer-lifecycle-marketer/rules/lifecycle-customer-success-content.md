### Good Customer Success Content

```
✓ Task-oriented
  → "How to [accomplish goal]"
  → Not "About [Feature]"

✓ Scannable
  → Headers, bullets, numbered steps
  → Users skim, don't read

✓ Visual
  → Screenshots, GIFs, videos
  → Show, don't just tell

✓ Searchable
  → Use terms customers use
  → Not internal jargon

✓ Maintained
  → Updated when product changes
  → Dated content = distrust

✓ Progressive
  → Basic → intermediate → advanced
  → Don't overwhelm beginners
```

### Bad Customer Success Content

```
✗ Feature-oriented
  → "The Dashboard" vs "How to track your metrics"
  → Think user task, not product structure

✗ Walls of text
  → No headers, no visuals
  → Users give up, contact support

✗ Outdated screenshots
  → Shows old UI
  → Confuses users, damages trust

✗ Jargon-heavy
  → Internal terms users don't know
  → "Run the cron job" vs "Schedule updates"

✗ Hidden content
  → Hard to find in navigation
  → Poor search results

✗ No examples
  → Theory without application
  → Users want to copy/adapt
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Support as content** — "Contact us" instead of answering
- **Marketing as support** — Feature pages ≠ how-to guides
- **One format fits all** — Some need video, some need text
- **Outdated content** — Old screenshots destroy trust
- **Hard to find** — Poor search, bad navigation
- **No feedback loop** — Not measuring helpfulness
- **Feature launches without docs** — Users can't adopt what's undocumented
