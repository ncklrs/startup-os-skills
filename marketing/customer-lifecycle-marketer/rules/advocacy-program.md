  → Start with easy asks (review, quote)
  → Build to bigger commitments

  → NPS + health score + usage triggers
  → Not just CSM gut feel

✓ Recognition program
  → Public acknowledgment
  → Exclusive community/perks

✓ Easy participation
  → Clear process, minimal friction
  → Templates, support, scheduling help
```

### Bad Advocacy Programs

```
✗ Asking unhappy customers
  → Damages relationship, gets negative content

✗ No reciprocity
  → All take, no give
  → Advocates burn out

✗ One-time asks
  → No ongoing relationship
  → Miss repeat opportunities

✗ Only big asks
  → "Be on stage at our conference"
  → No ladder of smaller asks

✗ No tracking
  → Same customer asked repeatedly
  → No measurement of impact
