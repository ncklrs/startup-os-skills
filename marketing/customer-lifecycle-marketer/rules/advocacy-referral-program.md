## Referral Program Design

**Impact: HIGH**

Referred customers have 37% higher retention and 16% higher LTV than non-referred customers. A well-designed referral program turns customer success into acquisition engine.

### Referral Program Types

| Type | Mechanic | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **One-sided** | Referrer gets reward | Simple, low-friction |
| **Two-sided** | Both parties get reward | Higher conversion, fairness |
| **Tiered** | More referrals = better rewards | Power referrers, gamification |
| **Points-based** | Accumulate for rewards | Ongoing engagement |
| **Give-to-get** | Referrer gives discount | Generosity framing |

### Reward Structures

| Reward Type | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|-------------|------|------|----------|
| **Cash/credit** | Universal value | Can feel transactional | B2B, high ACV |
| **Discount** | Ties to product | Only if they need it | Subscription |
| **Free months** | Encourages retention | Fixed value | SaaS |
| **Premium features** | Low cost to give | May not value | Feature-gated |
| **Swag** | Brand building | Low perceived value | Community-driven |
| **Charity donation** | Feel-good | Less personal incentive | Mission-driven |

### Two-Sided Reward Examples

| Company | Referrer Gets | Referee Gets |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Dropbox** | 500MB storage | 500MB storage |
| **Uber** | $10 credit | $10 credit |
| **Airbnb** | $25 credit | $25 credit |
| **Notion** | $5 credit | $10 credit |

### Good Referral Programs

```
✓ Simple mechanics
  → One click to share
  → Clear reward explanation

✓ Meaningful rewards
  → Worth the social capital spent
  → Immediate or near-term

✓ Two-sided incentive
  → Referrer AND referee benefit
  → Easier to share ("I'm giving you something")

✓ Multiple share methods
  → Link, email, social, in-app
  → Meet users where they are

✓ Progress visibility
  → Track referred friends
  → See pending/completed rewards

✓ Timely prompts
  → After positive experience
  → Not during onboarding
```

### Bad Referral Programs

```
✗ Complicated rules
  → "Refer 3 friends who each spend $50..."
  → Confusion kills participation

✗ Weak rewards
  → 5% discount on $10/month product
  → Not worth asking friends

✗ One-sided only
  → "You get $20" but friend gets nothing
  → Feels selfish to share

✗ Hard to find
  → Buried in settings
  → Only in footer link

✗ Slow reward delivery
  → Wait 3 months for credit
  → Breaks reward loop

✗ No tracking
  → Did my friend sign up?
  → Is my reward coming?
```

### Referral Prompt Timing

| Trigger | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **After first success** | High enthusiasm, wants to share |
| **After NPS 9-10** | Explicitly said they'd recommend |
| **After milestone** | Achievement = sharing mood |
| **After positive support** | Gratitude moment |
| **Account anniversary** | Celebration + reflection |
| **After feature launch** | New thing to share |

### Referral Prompt Examples

```
✓ In-app prompt (after success):
"You just [achieved milestone]! Know someone who'd benefit?
Share your referral link and you'll both get [reward]."
[Copy Link] [Send Email] [Share on LinkedIn]

✓ Email (after NPS 9-10):
Subject: Share the love (and get $25)

You rated us a 10 — thank you!

Know someone who'd benefit from [Product]?
Share your unique link and you'll both get $25 credit.

[Your referral link]

Thanks for spreading the word.

✓ CSM ask:
"You mentioned [Product] has really helped with [goal].
Is there anyone else in your network facing similar challenges?
We have a referral program that gives you both a free month."
```

### Referral Link Best Practices

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **URL** | Short, memorable: company.com/r/name |
| **Personalization** | Include referrer name in landing |
| **Attribution** | Track through conversion |
| **Expiry** | None or long (90+ days) |
| **Shareability** | Works on mobile, desktop, social |

### Referral Landing Page

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Referrer name] thinks you'd love [Product]     │
│                                                  │
│  Get [reward] when you sign up                   │
│                                                  │
│  [Sign Up Now — Claim Your [Reward]]             │
│                                                  │
│  "What [Referrer] gets: [Their reward]"          │
│                                                  │
│  [Social proof: X customers, Y rating]           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Referral Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Participation rate** | Referrers / Customers | 10-30% |
| **Shares per referrer** | Total shares / Referrers | 2-5 |
| **Share → signup rate** | Signups / Shares | 5-15% |
| **Signup → convert rate** | Conversions / Signups | 20-40% |
| **Referral CAC** | Reward cost / Conversion | Should be < organic CAC |

### Referral Funnel

New Customers

Example: 1,000 customers → 200 referrers → 600 shares → 60 visits → 18 signups → 7 new customers
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Asking too early** — Wait for proven value, not day 1
- **Complicated rewards** — Simple beats clever
- **One-time ask** — Ongoing program with multiple prompts
- **Invisible program** — Must be discoverable, not hidden
- **No fraud protection** — Will be exploited if valuable
- **Slow reward fulfillment** — Instant or next-day builds habit
- **Generic sharing** — Personalized links convert better
