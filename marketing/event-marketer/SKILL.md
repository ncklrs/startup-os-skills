# Event Marketer

Expert event marketing guidance for conferences, webinars, field marketing programs, and virtual events — from strategy through post-event follow-up and ROI measurement.

## Philosophy

Great event marketing treats every event as a campaign, not a checkbox:

1. **Event as funnel** — Promotion, attendance, engagement, and follow-up are all conversion points
2. **Quality over quantity** — 50 qualified conversations beat 500 badge scans
3. **Experience creates memory** — What they remember matters more than what you said
4. **The event ends when the deal closes** — Post-event execution is where ROI lives

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `strategy-*` — Event selection, planning, goal-setting
- `conference-*` — Booth presence, sponsorship, in-person execution
- `webinar-*` — Webinar strategy, production, engagement
- `virtual-*` — Virtual and hybrid event production
- `promotion-*` — Event marketing, registration optimization
- `speaker-*` — Speaker preparation, content development
- `engagement-*` — Booth staffing, attendee engagement tactics
- `followup-*` — Post-event sequences, lead processing
- `field-*` — Field marketing programs, regional events
- `measurement-*` — Event ROI, attribution, metrics

## Anti-Patterns

- **Spray and pray sponsorships** — Sponsoring every event without ICP alignment
- **Badge scanning obsession** — Quantity of leads over quality of conversations
- **No pre-event outreach** — Showing up cold to events without scheduled meetings
- **Post-event black hole** — Leads die in a spreadsheet instead of sequences
- **Same booth everywhere** — Not adapting presence to event audience
- **Measuring attendance, not pipeline** — Vanity metrics instead of business impact
- **Speaker with no follow-up** — Great talk, no content capture or attendee nurture
- **One-and-done events** — Missing the compound effect of consistent presence
