## Conference Booth Presence

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Your booth is your physical embodiment at an event. It should attract ICP, facilitate quality conversations, and capture actionable leads — not just collect badge scans.

### Booth Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Visible from 30 feet** | Large, high-contrast signage with one clear message |
| **Approachable from 10 feet** | Open layout, no barriers, welcoming staff positioning |
| **Engaging at 3 feet** | Demo stations, interactive elements, conversation starters |
| **Memorable at 0 feet** | Quality swag, product experience, personal connection |

### Booth Size Selection

| Booth Size | When to Choose | Staffing Need | Budget Range |
|------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **10x10** | First time at event, testing ROI | 2-3 people | $10k-30k |
| **10x20** | Proven event, need demo space | 4-6 people | $25k-60k |
| **20x20** | Tier 1 priority, meeting rooms needed | 6-10 people | $50k-150k |
| **Island (30x30+)** | Flagship event, major launch | 10-20 people | $150k-500k+ |

### Booth Layout Best Practices

```
Bad Layout (Closed):
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  ████████████████████   │  ← Table barrier
│                         │
│    Staff   Staff        │  ← Staff behind barrier
│                         │
└─────────────────────────┘
  Attendees can't enter easily

Good Layout (Open):
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Demo ○    ○ Demo       │  ← Standing demo stations
│       Staff             │
│            Staff        │  ← Staff in open space
│  ○ Charging   ○ Meeting │  ← Value-add stations
└─────────────────────────┘
  Multiple entry points, reasons to stay
```

### Essential Booth Elements

| Element | Purpose | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Main signage** | Attract from distance, communicate value | Critical |
| **Demo stations** | Show product, enable hands-on | Critical |
| **Lead capture** | Collect information systematically | Critical |
| **Meeting space** | Private conversations for qualified leads | High |
| **Charging station** | Draw traffic, provide value | Medium |
| **Interactive element** | Gamification, engagement | Medium |
| **Swag display** | Conversation starter, brand recall | Low-Medium |

### Signage Messaging Framework

| Zone | Message Type | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Header (seen from far)** | Single benefit statement | "Ship secrets securely" |
| **Secondary (seen mid-range)** | How or proof point | "Used by 500+ engineering teams" |
| **Booth level (seen up close)** | Specific features/CTAs | "See a demo" / "Free trial" |

### Good Booth Presence

```
✓ One clear message visible from across the hall
  → "Secrets management for engineering teams"

✓ Interactive demo anyone can try
  → Touch screen with 2-minute product tour

✓ Conversation starters beyond "Can I scan you?"
  → "What's your biggest secrets management headache?"

✓ Private meeting space for qualified conversations
  → Enclosed corner with seating for 4

✓ Staff positioned in the aisle, not behind tables
  → Standing at booth edges, making eye contact
```

### Bad Booth Presence

```
✗ Wall of text explaining everything
  → No one reads paragraphs at trade shows

✗ Staff sitting behind tables on phones
  → Unapproachable, looks disinterested

✗ No clear value proposition
  → Generic "Innovating for tomorrow" messaging

✗ Only capturing badges without qualification
  → 1,000 scans, 0 qualified leads

✗ Same booth design for every event
  → Developer conference needs different vibe than enterprise summit
```

### Pre-Event Booth Checklist

| Timeline | Tasks |
|----------|-------|
| **8 weeks out** | Finalize booth design, order signage |
| **6 weeks out** | Confirm staffing, book travel |
| **4 weeks out** | Ship materials, test demos |
| **2 weeks out** | Staff training, finalize talking points |
| **1 week out** | Confirm shipping received, final logistics |
| **Day before** | Booth setup, tech testing, team walk-through |

### Lead Capture Best Practices

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Badge scanning app** | Fast, syncs with CRM | No qualification data |
| **Custom form + scanner** | Qualification questions | Slower capture |
| **Business cards** | Personal, flexible | Manual entry required |
| **QR to landing page** | Self-service, detailed | Requires attendee action |

### Lead Qualification at Booth

```
Quick qualification questions (pick 2-3):

1. "What brings you to our booth today?"
   → Intent signal

2. "What tools are you using for [problem] today?"
   → Competitive intel, pain level

3. "What's your role on the team?"
   → Decision maker vs practitioner

4. "Timeline for making changes?"
   → Urgency signal

Capture rating:
- Hot: Right ICP, active pain, near-term timeline
- Warm: Right ICP, some interest, unclear timeline
- Cold: Wrong ICP or no real interest
```

### Booth Traffic Drivers

| Tactic | Effort | Effectiveness |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Speaking session same day** | High | Very High |
| **Pre-scheduled meetings** | Medium | Very High |
| **Social media announcements** | Low | Medium |
| **Booth games/prizes** | Medium | Medium |
| **Quality swag (not tchotchkes)** | Low | Low-Medium |
| **Sponsored coffee/snacks** | Medium | Medium |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Badge harvesting** — Scanning everyone without qualification
- **Feature dumping** — Talking at visitors, not listening
- **Ghost booth** — No one manning the booth during sessions
- **Pitch-first approach** — Launching into demo before understanding needs
- **Swag hoarding** — Giving away premium items to anyone who walks by
- **No meeting scheduling** — Letting hot leads leave without next steps
- **Ignoring competition** — Not knowing what competitors are saying nearby
