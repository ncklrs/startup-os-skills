## Event Selection & Planning

**Impact: CRITICAL**

The events you choose to attend or host determine your entire event marketing ROI. Wrong events waste budget and team time. Right events accelerate pipeline.

### Event Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria | Weight | Questions to Ask |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **ICP Alignment** | 30% | What % of attendees match your ideal customer profile? |
| **Decision-Maker Density** | 25% | Are buyers there, or just practitioners? |
| **Competitive Presence** | 15% | Are competitors there? Is that good or bad? |
| **Historical ROI** | 15% | Have you/peers seen results from this event? |
| **Cost Efficiency** | 10% | What's the cost per potential qualified contact? |
| **Strategic Value** | 5% | Press, partnerships, brand associations? |

### Event Scoring Matrix

```
Score each event 1-5 on each criterion, multiply by weight:

Example: SaaStr Annual
┌───────────────────────┬────────┬───────┬──────────┐
│ Criteria              │ Weight │ Score │ Weighted │
├───────────────────────┼────────┼───────┼──────────┤
│ ICP Alignment         │ 30%    │ 5     │ 1.50     │
│ Decision-Maker Density│ 25%    │ 4     │ 1.00     │
│ Competitive Presence  │ 15%    │ 3     │ 0.45     │
│ Historical ROI        │ 15%    │ 4     │ 0.60     │
│ Cost Efficiency       │ 10%    │ 2     │ 0.20     │
│ Strategic Value       │ 5%     │ 5     │ 0.25     │
├───────────────────────┼────────┼───────┼──────────┤
│ Total                 │ 100%   │       │ 4.00     │
└───────────────────────┴────────┴───────┴──────────┘

Score interpretation:
4.0+ = Must attend/sponsor
3.0-3.9 = Strong consideration
2.0-2.9 = Selective participation
<2.0 = Skip or reconsider
```

### Annual Event Planning Timeline

| Timeframe | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| **Q4 (Year Prior)** | Evaluate previous year, set next year's budget, book Tier 1 events |
| **Q1** | Finalize H1 events, begin speaker submissions, plan user conference |
| **Q2** | Execute H1 events, finalize H2 calendar, adjust based on learnings |
| **Q3** | Execute H2 major events, begin next year planning |
| **Q4** | Complete year's events, comprehensive ROI analysis, lock next year |

### Event Budget Planning

| Company Stage | Events % of Marketing Budget | Focus Areas |
|---------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Pre-Seed/Seed** | 5-10% | Small meetups, hosted webinars |
| **Series A** | 10-15% | Industry conferences, regional events |
| **Series B** | 15-20% | Tier 1 conferences, owned events |
| **Series C+** | 20-30% | User conference, global events, field marketing |

### Good Event Selection

```
✓ Start with ICP mapping
  → "60% of attendees are DevOps engineers at companies 200-2000"

✓ Validate with past attendees/exhibitors
  → "Talked to 3 companies who sponsored last year"

✓ Calculate cost per potential contact
  → "$50k sponsorship / 500 ICP-fit attendees = $100/contact"

✓ Consider the full funnel
  → "We can book 15 meetings pre-event, speak on a panel, and host a dinner"

✓ Plan for multi-year presence
  → "Year 1 brand awareness, Year 2 pipeline, Year 3 expansion"
```

### Bad Event Selection

```
✗ "Our competitor is there so we have to be"
  → Not strategic, reactive spending

✗ "It's a big event with lots of attendees"
  → Attendee volume ≠ ICP alignment

✗ "The sales team wants to go"
  → No business case or success criteria

✗ "We've always sponsored this event"
  → Past presence doesn't justify future spend

✗ "They gave us a good discount"
  → Cheap isn't valuable if attendees don't convert
```

### Event Type Mix Recommendation

| Event Type | % of Events Budget | Purpose |
|------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Tier 1 Industry Conferences** | 30-40% | Brand, awareness, press |
| **Vertical/Niche Events** | 20-25% | Pipeline, qualified leads |
| **Hosted Events (Webinars, Dinners)** | 20-25% | Owned audience, high conversion |
| **Field/Regional Events** | 10-15% | ABM, local relationships |
| **Experimental/New Events** | 5-10% | Test new audiences |

### Pre-Event Success Planning

Before committing to any event, define:

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Primary Goal** | Generate 50 MQLs from DevOps buyers |
| **Success Metrics** | 200 badge scans, 50 qualified conversations, 20 meetings |
| **Break-even Calculation** | $40k spend / $5k average deal = 8 deals needed |
| **Pipeline Target** | $400k pipeline generated (10x event cost) |
| **Pre-event Outreach** | 100 prospects contacted, 25 meetings scheduled |

### Anti-Patterns

- **FOMO-driven selection** — Sponsoring because competitors are there
- **No ICP analysis** — Assuming big event = good event
- **Year-over-year autopilot** — Re-sponsoring without ROI review
- **Single-event thinking** — Not building multi-year relationships
- **Last-minute decisions** — Best sponsorship tiers sell out 6+ months early
- **Ignoring speaking opportunities** — Booths without content presence
