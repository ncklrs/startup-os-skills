User conferences are the pinnacle of owned events. They build community, drive retention, fuel expansion, and generate content that lasts all year. Done well, they become the industry event your customers won't miss.

### User Conference Goals

| **Customer expansion** | Upsell pipeline, feature adoption | Training completion, cert signups |
| **Community building** | User connections made, forum activity | Social engagement, UGC |
| **Product feedback** | Feature requests, roadmap validation | Advisory board signups |
| **Brand awareness** | Press coverage, social reach | Prospect attendance |
| **Content creation** | Sessions recorded, assets created | Content views post-event |

### Attendee Mix Strategy

| Attendee Type | Target % | Purpose |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| **Customers** | 60-70% | Core audience, success stories |
| **Prospects** | 15-25% | Pipeline, social proof exposure |
| **Partners** | 10-15% | Ecosystem, co-marketing |
| **Press/Analysts** | 2-5% | Coverage, validation |

### Good User Conference Practices

```
✓ Customer speakers outnumber internal speakers 2:1
  → Credibility, real stories, community voice

✓ Exclusive product announcements
  → Rewards attendance, creates buzz

✓ Facilitated networking (not just cocktails)
  → Birds of a feather, matching, structured intros

✓ Certification or training included
  → Tangible takeaway, skill development

✓ Executive access
  → Customers meet leadership, feel valued

✓ Advisory board recruitment
  → Engaged customers, product feedback loop
```

### Bad User Conference Practices

```
✗ Mostly internal presenters
  → Feels like a sales pitch, not community

✗ No customer-only content
  → Prospects dilute customer experience

✗ Keynote-heavy, workshop-light
  → Passive experience, less valuable

✗ No follow-up on feedback
  → Surveys collected, nothing changes

✗ Charging customers high prices
  → Already paying for product, feels extractive

✗ Same content as webinars
  → No reason to travel
```

### Customer Speaker Recruitment

| Approach | Response Rate | Quality |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **CSM recommendation** | High | Very High |
| **Power user identification** | Medium | High |
| **Open CFP to customers** | Low | Variable |
| **Case study interview converts** | Medium | High |
| **Community forum leaders** | High | High |

**Speaker incentives:**
- Conference pass (free)
- Travel coverage (flights, hotel)
- VIP experience (exec dinner, backstage)
- Social promotion (LinkedIn boost)
- Speaker gift (quality, not tchotchke)

### Sponsorship Tiers for User Conferences

| Tier | Price Range | Includes |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Platinum** | $50k-150k | Keynote slot, prime booth, dinner sponsor |
| **Gold** | $25k-50k | Breakout slot, booth, branded moment |
| **Silver** | $10k-25k | Booth, logo placement, attendee list |
| **Bronze** | $5k-10k | Logo, swag bag insert, list |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Good | Great | Excellent |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| **Registration** | 500+ | 1000+ | 2000+ |
| **Customer attendance** | 60% | 70% | 80%+ |
| **Session satisfaction** | 4.0/5 | 4.3/5 | 4.5/5 |
| **NPS** | 40 | 60 | 80+ |
| **Content captured** | 50% sessions | 75% sessions | 90%+ sessions |
| **Expansion pipeline** | 2x cost | 5x cost | 10x cost |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Product launch overshadows community** — Balance announcements with customer focus
- **No customer advisory input** — Plan without customer feedback
- **One-size-fits-all content** — Beginner and expert in same sessions
- **Sponsor overload** — Expo feels like sales gauntlet
- **No content longevity** — Event ends, content disappears
- **Ignoring virtual attendees** — Hybrid means two experiences, not one
- **No year-round community** — Conference only touchpoint
- **Charging prohibitive prices** — Excludes smaller customers
