## Speaker Preparation & Content

**Impact: HIGH**

Speakers are your most powerful event asset. A great talk generates leads, builds authority, and creates content that outlives the event. A poor talk damages brand perception and wastes the opportunity.

### Speaking Opportunity Types

| Type | Audience | Prep Time | Lead Gen Potential |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Keynote** | Full event | 40-80 hours | Very High |
| **Breakout session** | Track attendees | 20-40 hours | High |
| **Panel discussion** | Niche audience | 5-10 hours | Medium |
| **Lightning talk** | Quick exposure | 5-10 hours | Low-Medium |
| **Workshop** | Engaged learners | 30-60 hours | Very High |
| **Fireside chat** | Intimate, executive | 2-5 hours | High |

### CFP (Call for Proposals) Strategy

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **Title** | Benefit-focused, curiosity-inducing, not promotional |
| **Abstract** | 3-5 sentences: problem, solution, takeaways |
| **Outline** | Clear structure showing you have substance |
| **Speaker bio** | Relevant credibility for this topic |
| **Why this talk** | Unique angle, new data, fresh perspective |

### Good CFP Titles

```
✓ "How We Eliminated Secrets Sprawl Across 200 Microservices"
  → Specific outcome, scale, implies learnings

✓ "The $2M Mistake That Changed How We Think About Security"
  → Story hook, dollar figure, transformation

✓ "5 Patterns for Zero-Trust Secrets Management (That Actually Work)"
  → Number, specific topic, credibility qualifier

✓ "From 45-Minute Deploys to 4: Our Journey to Secure CI/CD"
  → Before/after, journey implies lessons
```

### Bad CFP Titles

```
✗ "Introduction to SecretStash"
  → Product pitch, not value-focused

✗ "Best Practices for Security"
  → Generic, could be anything

✗ "Why We're the Best Solution"
  → Self-promotional, will be rejected

✗ "The Future of DevSecOps"
  → Vague, overused, no unique angle
```

### Talk Content Framework

```
The STAR Framework for Technical Talks:

S — Situation (5%): Set the context
    "Every engineering team faces this problem..."

T — Tension (15%): Create the problem
    "Here's what happens when you don't address it..."

A — Action (60%): Deliver the solution
    "Here's exactly what we did and how..."

R — Results (20%): Prove it worked
    "Here's what happened, with numbers..."
```

### Slide Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **One idea per slide** | If you're explaining two things, use two slides |
| **Readable from back** | 30+ pt font, high contrast |
| **Visual > text** | Diagrams, screenshots, not paragraphs |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Build complex ideas across slides |
| **Branded but subtle** | Logo in corner, not everywhere |

### Good Slide Examples

```
✓ Slide: Single stat, large
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │                             │
   │         87%                 │
   │   reduction in secrets      │
   │   sprawl in 90 days         │
   │                             │
   └─────────────────────────────┘

✓ Slide: Architecture diagram
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │   [Simple visual diagram    │
   │    showing before/after     │
   │    or system architecture]  │
   │                             │
   │   Clear labels, arrows      │
   └─────────────────────────────┘

✓ Slide: Code snippet (syntax highlighted)
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │   # What changed            │
   │   secret = get_secret()     │
   │                             │
   │   ← 3-5 lines max           │
   │   ← Large, readable font    │
   └─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Bad Slide Examples

```
✗ Wall of text
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet  │
   │ consectetur adipiscing elit │
   │ sed do eiusmod tempor       │
   │ incididunt ut labore et...  │
   │ 12pt font continues for     │
   │ another 15 lines...         │
   └─────────────────────────────┘

✗ Too many elements
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ LOGO  Title  LOGO  LOGO     │
   │ ┌─┐ ┌─┐ ┌─┐ ┌─┐ ┌─┐ ┌─┐    │
   │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │    │
   │ Chart  Bullets  Image       │
   │ Footer | Date | Contact     │
   └─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Speaker Preparation Timeline

| Timeframe | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| **8 weeks** | CFP submission, topic development |
| **6 weeks** | Outline, research, story development |
| **4 weeks** | Slides v1, practice run with feedback |
| **2 weeks** | Slides v2, full rehearsal, timing check |
| **1 week** | Final slides, tech check, backup plan |
| **Day before** | Rehearsal at venue (if possible) |
| **Day of** | Early arrival, room check, last review |

### Speaker Coaching Checklist

| Area | What to Practice |
|------|------------------|
| **Opening** | Hook in first 30 seconds, no throat clearing |
| **Pacing** | Pause for effect, vary speed |
| **Body language** | Eye contact, movement, no lectern hiding |
| **Transitions** | Clear signal when moving topics |
| **Q&A prep** | Anticipated questions, bridge to content |
| **Time management** | Practice with timer, know cut points |
| **Tech backup** | What if slides fail? Projector dies? |

### Good Speaker Behaviors

```
✓ Start with a hook, not "Hi, I'm..."
  → "Last month, we had a production incident that cost us $50k."

✓ Tell stories, not just facts
  → "Let me tell you about the engineer who..."

✓ Use the stage/space
  → Move purposefully, own the room

✓ Make eye contact with different sections
  → Not just the front row, scan the room

✓ Pause after key points
  → Let important information sink in

✓ End with clear CTA
  → "Try this in your environment this week..."
```

### Bad Speaker Behaviors

```
✗ Reading slides word-for-word
  → Audience can read faster, you become unnecessary

✗ "I know you can't read this, but..."
  → Fix the slide, don't apologize for it

✗ Going over time
  → Disrespectful to audience and next speaker

✗ Self-deprecating opener
  → "I'm not sure why I'm here" kills credibility

✗ Ending with "Any questions?"
  → End with impact, then Q&A separately
```

### Q&A Best Practices

| Scenario | Response Strategy |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Easy question** | Answer directly, briefly |
| **Complex question** | Acknowledge, give partial answer, offer to follow up |
| **Off-topic question** | Bridge back to talk content |
| **Hostile question** | Stay calm, acknowledge concern, don't get defensive |
| **No questions** | Have 2-3 seed questions ready, or share common questions |
| **Rambling question** | Politely interrupt, summarize, answer the core |

### Post-Talk Optimization

| Activity | Purpose | Timing |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Share slides** | Lead capture, value delivery | Same day |
| **Post talk video** | Content repurposing | 1-2 weeks |
| **Write companion blog** | SEO, deeper content | 1 week |
| **Social clips** | Reach, authority | Same week |
| **Attendee follow-up** | Lead nurture | 1-3 days |
| **Speaker page on website** | Credibility | Ongoing |

### Speaker Kit Contents

Every speaker should receive:
- [ ] Event details (date, time, location, format)
- [ ] Audience information (who, how many, technical level)
- [ ] Slide template (branded, correct ratio)
- [ ] Key messages to incorporate
- [ ] Product talking points (not script)
- [ ] CTA to include
- [ ] Tech specifications
- [ ] Rehearsal schedule
- [ ] Day-of logistics

### Measuring Talk Success

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Attendance** | Room count vs capacity | 70%+ full |
| **Engagement** | Q&A participation | 5+ questions |
| **Rating** | Post-event survey | 4.2+ / 5 |
| **Leads** | Post-talk signups/scans | 5-15% of attendees |
| **Content reach** | Slides views, video plays | 2-5x attendees |
| **Social mentions** | Twitter, LinkedIn tags | 10+ organic |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Product pitch disguised as talk** — Audiences see through it
- **No rehearsal** — "Winging it" shows, credibility drops
- **Ignoring time limits** — Going over is disrespectful
- **Generic content** — Same talk everywhere, no customization
- **No follow-up strategy** — Talk ends, leads disappear
- **Speaker as solo act** — No supporting content or team
- **Ignoring speaker preparation** — Assuming they know what they're doing
- **No content capture** — Talk happens, nothing recorded
