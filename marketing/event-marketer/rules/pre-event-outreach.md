## Pre-Event Outreach & Meeting Setting

**Impact: HIGH**

The most successful event exhibitors don't wait for booth traffic — they manufacture it. Pre-event outreach turns random encounters into scheduled conversations and maximizes ROI on travel and sponsorship.

### Pre-Event Outreach Goals

| Goal | Metric | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Scheduled meetings** | Meetings on calendar | 15-30 per major event |
| **Warm introductions** | Contacts aware of presence | 100-200 touches |
| **Booth appointments** | Specific time slots | 20-40 per day |
| **Dinner/event RSVPs** | Private event attendance | 80%+ target accounts |
| **Speaking promotion** | Session awareness | 100+ registrations |

### Target Identification Process

```
Step 1: Get attendee list
├── Request from event organizer (often included in sponsorship)
├── Scrape registration page (if public)
├── LinkedIn event/hashtag followers
└── Past attendee lists (if returning event)

Step 2: Match to CRM
├── Existing opportunities → AE outreach priority
├── Existing leads → Nurture + meeting offer
├── Target accounts → SDR prospecting
└── Net new accounts → Research and prioritize

Step 3: Prioritize
├── Tier 1: Active opportunities + target accounts
├── Tier 2: Past engaged leads + ICP fit
├── Tier 3: Broader ICP fit
└── Tier 4: General awareness
```

### Outreach Timeline

| Timing | Activity | Focus |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **8 weeks out** | Announce presence (social/email) | Awareness |
| **6 weeks out** | Personal outreach to Tier 1 | Meeting requests |
| **4 weeks out** | SDR sequence to Tier 2-3 | Broad outreach |
| **2 weeks out** | Follow-up to non-responders | Urgency |
| **1 week out** | Calendar confirmations | Lock meetings |
| **Day before** | Final logistics email | Reduce no-shows |

### Outreach Channel Strategy

| Channel | Best For | Response Rate |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **AE personal email** | Active opportunities | 30-50% |
| **SDR email sequence** | Cold/warm prospects | 10-20% |
| **LinkedIn message** | Connection requests + note | 15-25% |
| **Phone + voicemail** | High-priority targets | Variable |
| **Marketing email** | Broad awareness | 5-10% |
| **In-app notification** | Existing users | 15-25% |

### Good Pre-Event Emails

```
✓ Subject: "Coffee at [Event]? (I'm buying)"
  → Personal, low commitment, value offered

✓ Subject: "Quick hello at [Event] — 15 min?"
  → Time-boxed, easy to say yes

✓ Body: "I noticed your team is evaluating [solution area].
  Our booth is #234 — happy to show you how [Customer]
  cut their [metric] by 40% in a quick demo."
  → Relevant to their situation, specific value, social proof

✓ Body: "We're hosting a small dinner for DevOps leaders
  the evening of [Date]. Would love for you to join
  [Customer CISO] and 10 other security leaders."
  → Exclusive, peer group, specific attendees named
```

### Bad Pre-Event Emails

```
✗ Subject: "Visit our booth at [Event]!"
  → Generic, no value proposition, easy to ignore

✗ Body: "We'll be at booth #234. Stop by for a demo!"
  → No personalization, no reason to prioritize

✗ Body: "I'd love to learn more about your business
  and see how we can help."
  → Self-focused, vague, doesn't earn their time

✗ Body: "Don't miss our exclusive event for
  top industry leaders!"
  → Everyone gets this, not exclusive
```

### LinkedIn Outreach Playbook

```
Step 1: Connect (2-3 weeks before)
────────────────────────────────────
"Hi [Name] — Noticed we're both attending [Event].
I lead partnerships at [Company]. Would love to connect."

Step 2: Follow-up message (1 week after connecting)
────────────────────────────────────
"Thanks for connecting! Are you planning to attend
[specific session or activity]? Our team will be at booth
#234 — happy to grab a coffee and chat about [relevant topic]."

Step 3: Meeting request (if engaged)
────────────────────────────────────
"Would you have 15 minutes on [Day] between sessions?
I'd love to show you how we're helping teams like [Their Company]
with [specific challenge]. Here's a link to grab time: [link]"
```

### Meeting Scheduling Best Practices

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **Time slots** | 15-20 min (not 30-60) |
| **Location** | Booth meeting room, nearby lounge, or coffee area |
| **Calendar invite** | Include booth number, backup phone |
| **Confirmation** | Send reminder day before + morning of |
| **Buffer** | 10 min between meetings for overruns |
| **Backup** | Have colleague who can cover if you're running late |

### Meeting Slot Planning

```
Conference Day (10am-5pm show floor):

Meeting Slots (15 min each + 10 min buffer):
├── 10:00 - 10:15 (Meeting 1)
├── 10:25 - 10:40 (Meeting 2)
├── 10:50 - 11:05 (Meeting 3)
├── 11:15 - 11:30 (Meeting 4)
│   [Lunch / Roaming: 11:30 - 1:00]
├── 1:00 - 1:15 (Meeting 5)
├── 1:25 - 1:40 (Meeting 6)
├── 1:50 - 2:05 (Meeting 7)
│   [Break / Roaming: 2:05 - 3:00]
├── 3:00 - 3:15 (Meeting 8)
├── 3:25 - 3:40 (Meeting 9)
├── 3:50 - 4:05 (Meeting 10)
└── 4:15 - 4:30 (Meeting 11)

Result: 11 scheduled meetings + organic booth traffic
```

### SDR Pre-Event Sequence

```
Email 1 (6 weeks out): Event announcement
Subject: "Heading to [Event]?"
CTA: "Let me know if you'd like to connect"

Email 2 (4 weeks out): Value offer
Subject: "[Event] exclusive: [Resource/demo/meeting]"
CTA: "Book 15 minutes at our booth"

Email 3 (2 weeks out): Social proof
Subject: "Joining [Customer] and [Customer] at [Event]"
CTA: "Save a spot for your demo"

Email 4 (1 week out): Urgency
Subject: "Last few meeting slots at [Event]"
CTA: "Grab one before they're gone"

Phone call (Day 3-4 of sequence):
"Calling to see if you got my email about [Event]..."
```

### Outreach Tracking

| Metric | Target | Measure |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Outreach volume** | 200+ contacts | Emails/calls made |
| **Response rate** | 15-25% | Replies received |
| **Meeting booked rate** | 10-15% | Meetings scheduled |
| **Show rate** | 75%+ | Meetings held |
| **Conversion rate** | 30%+ | Meetings → opportunities |

### ABM Account Prioritization

| Account Tier | Pre-Event Investment | Outreach Approach |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Tier 1** (Top 10) | Custom invitation, exec involvement | CEO/CRO outreach, custom experience |
| **Tier 2** (Top 50) | Personal SDR sequence, dinner invite | AE + SDR coordinated outreach |
| **Tier 3** (Top 200) | Scaled personalized outreach | SDR sequence, booth appointment |
| **Tier 4** (ICP fit) | Marketing email, retargeting | Awareness, self-service booking |

### Good Pre-Event Coordination

```
✓ Sales, SDR, marketing aligned on target list
  → No duplicate outreach, unified message

✓ Clear meeting ownership
  → Each prospect has one owner driving outreach

✓ Shared calendar for booth meetings
  → No double-booking, visibility for team

✓ Meeting prep document shared
  → Who they are, what they care about, history

✓ Day-of check-in routine
  → Morning huddle on who's coming when
```

### Bad Pre-Event Coordination

```
✗ AE and SDR both emailing same prospect
  → Looks uncoordinated, damages brand

✗ Marketing sends blast, sales sends personal
  → Conflicting messages, confusion

✗ No centralized meeting calendar
  → Double-bookings, missed meetings

✗ Zero prep before meetings
  → "So what does your company do?" is embarrassing

✗ No confirmation process
  → 50% no-show rate on "scheduled" meetings
```

### Tools for Pre-Event Outreach

| Tool Type | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Scheduling** | Self-service booking | Calendly, Chili Piper, HubSpot Meetings |
| **Outreach** | Email sequences | Outreach, Salesloft, Apollo |
| **Enrichment** | Find attendees, data | LinkedIn Sales Nav, ZoomInfo |
| **Coordination** | Team calendar, tasks | Google Calendar, Asana |
| **CRM** | Track all activity | Salesforce, HubSpot |

### No-Show Prevention

| Tactic | Timing | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Confirmation email** | 1 week before | Medium |
| **Calendar reminder** | Day before | High |
| **Morning-of text/email** | Day of | Very High |
| **Backup slot offered** | In confirmation | Medium |
| **Value reminder** | In all reminders | High |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Waiting for booth traffic** — Passive approach leaves ROI on the table
- **Generic blast emails** — No personalization = no response
- **Outreach starting too late** — 1 week out is too late for busy executives
- **No meeting confirmation** — Assume scheduled = will show
- **Over-scheduling** — No buffer = cascading missed meetings
- **No target prioritization** — Equal effort on unequal opportunities
- **Sales/SDR conflict** — Uncoordinated outreach damages credibility
- **No follow-up on no-shows** — They didn't come, so you give up
