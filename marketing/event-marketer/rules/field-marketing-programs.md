## Field Marketing Programs

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Field marketing creates intimate, high-value experiences that large conferences can't. Executive dinners, roundtables, and regional events build relationships that convert at higher rates with larger deal sizes.

### Field Marketing Event Types

| Event Type | Attendee Count | Cost Range | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| **Executive dinner** | 8-15 | $5k-20k | C-level relationship building |
| **Roundtable discussion** | 12-20 | $3k-10k | Peer learning, thought leadership |
| **Workshop** | 15-30 | $5k-15k | Technical deep dive, hands-on |
| **Happy hour** | 20-50 | $3k-8k | Networking, community |
| **Roadshow stop** | 30-100 | $10k-30k | Product launch, regional reach |
| **Private event at conference** | 20-50 | $10k-40k | Concentrated access |

### Roundtable Discussion Framework

| **Industry trend/challenge** | High | Medium |
| **Peer benchmarking** | Very High | High |
| **Expert-led learning** | Medium | Medium |

**Facilitation Tips:**

- Prepared questions, not a script
- Equal airtime management

- Clear takeaways summary

### Good Field Event Invitations

```
✓ Subject: "Exclusive dinner: CISOs on Zero-Trust Adoption"
  → Exclusive, peer group, relevant topic

✓ Subject: "[First Name], join 12 DevOps leaders in Austin"
  → Personalized, small group, specific location

✓ Body: "You'll join peers from [Company], [Company], and [Company]
  to discuss [specific challenge]. No pitches, just peer learning."
  → Social proof, clear expectation, no-pitch promise

✓ "Space is limited to 15 attendees to ensure quality discussion"
  → Real scarcity, explains the intimate nature
```

### Bad Field Event Invitations

```
✗ Subject: "You're invited to dinner!"
  → Generic, no value proposition

✗ Body: "Join us for an evening to learn about our product"
  → Pitch-focused, not peer-focused

✗ "Exclusive event for our top prospects"
  → Self-focused, reveals sales intent

✗ "RSVP for this can't-miss opportunity!"
  → Hyperbolic, no specific value
```

### Private Event at Conference

**When to Do:**
- Tier 1 conference with high ICP density
- Your booth presence is limited
- Want intimate access to specific accounts
- Evening slot available

**Format Options:**
| Format | Timing | Attendees |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Breakfast** | 7-9am | 20-30 early risers |
| **Lunch** | 12-1:30pm | 25-40 away from expo |
| **Happy hour** | 5:30-7:30pm | 40-75 after sessions |
| **Dinner** | 7:30-10pm | 12-20 intimate |

### Invitation Strategy

| Channel | Best For | Response Rate |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **SDR/AE personal email** | Prospects they own | 15-25% |
| **Marketing email** | Broad list, lower priority | 5-10% |
| **LinkedIn DM** | Net-new, cold outreach | 10-15% |
| **Phone + email combo** | Hot prospects | 20-30% |
| **Customer referral** | Peer invitation | 25-35% |

### Invitation Cadence

```
Week -4: Save the date (high-priority targets)
Week -3: Full invitation (all targets)
Week -2: Reminder + new angle (non-responders)
Week -1: Final spots / urgency (non-responders)
Day -2: Confirmation + logistics (confirmed)
Day -1: Final reminder (confirmed)
Day +1: Thank you + follow-up (attended)
```

### Field Event Success Metrics

| Metric | Good | Great | Excellent |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| **Attendance rate** | 60% | 70% | 80%+ |
| **Target account attendance** | 50% | 65% | 75%+ |
| **Meeting conversion** | 30% | 40% | 50%+ |
| **Pipeline generated** | 3x cost | 5x cost | 10x cost |
| **NPS of event** | 40 | 60 | 80+ |

### Good Field Event Practices

```
✓ "No-pitch" promise (and keep it)
  → Builds trust, differentiates from vendor events

✓ Customer co-host
  → Credibility, peer dynamic, better attendance

✓ Executive presence from your team
  → Shows investment, enables relationship building

✓ Pre-event calls with key attendees
  → Understand their interests, prepare for conversations

✓ Immediate next steps scheduled on-site
  → Book meetings before they leave
```

### Bad Field Event Practices

```
✗ Product pitch disguised as dinner
  → Breaks trust, attendees won't return

✗ No pre-event outreach to attendees
  → Missed opportunity to personalize, qualify

✗ All prospects, no customers
  → No credibility, feels like a sales trap

✗ Junior staff only
  → Doesn't match attendee seniority

✗ No follow-up plan
  → Relationships built then dropped
```

### Budget Allocation by Component

| Component | % of Budget | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Venue + F&B** | 50-60% | Don't skimp on experience |
| **Travel** | 20-25% | Team + sometimes speakers |
| **Materials** | 5-10% | Minimal, non-salesy |
| **Pre/Post marketing** | 10-15% | Invitations, follow-up |

### Post-Event Actions

| Timing | Action | Owner |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Same night** | Brief notes to CRM | Attendees |
| **Day +1** | Thank you email | Marketing |
| **Day +2-3** | Personal AE/SDR follow-up | Sales |
| **Week +1** | Follow-up content | Marketing |
| **Week +2** | Meeting conversion check | Sales management |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Over-attendance** — 50 people at a "roundtable" kills discussion
- **Under-qualifying invites** — Wrong seniority or ICP fit
- **No customer presence** — All sales, no peer credibility
- **Product-focused agenda** — Should be topic/challenge focused
- **Poor venue selection** — Loud restaurant, bad food, wrong vibe
- **No pre-event engagement** — Cold attendees, awkward intros
- **Sales-only representation** — No exec presence, unbalanced
- **Ignoring logistics** — Parking, timing, dietary needs
