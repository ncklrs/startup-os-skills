## Event Promotion & Registration

**Impact: CRITICAL**

The best event with poor promotion fails. Great promotion creates anticipation, drives quality registrations, and sets expectations that lead to attendance and engagement.

### Promotion Timeline Framework

| Phase | Timing | Focus | Channels |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Announce** | 6-8 weeks out | Awareness, early bird | Email, social, PR |
| **Build** | 4-6 weeks out | Credibility, speakers | Ads, partnerships |
| **Push** | 2-4 weeks out | Urgency, FOMO | All channels, retargeting |
| **Final** | 1 week out | Last call, scarcity | Email, SMS, social |
| **Remind** | Day before + morning of | Attendance | Email, calendar |

### Channel Strategy by Event Type

| Event Type | Primary Channels | Secondary Channels |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Industry Conference** | Email, LinkedIn, paid social | PR, content, partners |
| **Webinar** | Email, LinkedIn, content syndication | Paid ads, social |
| **User Conference** | Email, in-app, customer success | Community, social |
| **Field Event** | SDR outreach, email, ABM ads | LinkedIn, partners |
| **Virtual Summit** | Paid social, email, speakers | Influencers, PR |

### Registration Form Optimization

| Field | Necessity | Impact on Conversion |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Email** | Required | Baseline |
| **Name** | Required | Minimal impact |
| **Company** | Usually required | -5-10% conversion |
| **Job Title** | Optional/progressive | -5-10% conversion |
| **Phone** | Avoid unless needed | -15-20% conversion |
| **Company Size** | Optional | -5-10% conversion |
| **Use case question** | Optional | -5-10% but high value |

**Rule of thumb:** Every additional field costs 5-10% conversion. Collect only what you'll actually use for segmentation.

### Email Promotion Sequence

```
Email 1: Announcement (6 weeks out)
Subject: "Save the date: [Event Name] on [Date]"
Focus: What it is, why it matters, early registration

Email 2: Speaker reveal (4 weeks out)
Subject: "[Speaker Name] is joining us for [Topic]"
Focus: Credibility, agenda preview

Email 3: Content preview (3 weeks out)
Subject: "Here's what we'll cover at [Event]"
Focus: Learning outcomes, value proposition

Email 4: Social proof (2 weeks out)
Subject: "Join 500+ [role] at [Event]"
Focus: Who's attending, FOMO

Email 5: Last call (1 week out)
Subject: "Final week to register for [Event]"
Focus: Urgency, scarcity if applicable

Email 6: Reminder (1 day before)
Subject: "[Event] is tomorrow — here's your link"
Focus: Logistics, how to join

Email 7: Day-of (1 hour before)
Subject: "Starting soon: [Event]"
Focus: Join link, excitement
```

### Good Promotion Copy

```
✓ "Join 500+ DevOps engineers learning how to secure secrets at scale"
  → Social proof + specific audience + clear benefit

✓ "Limited to 50 seats — 12 spots remaining"
  → Real scarcity, not manufactured

✓ "You'll walk away with a secrets management checklist your team can use Monday"
  → Tangible, immediate value

✓ "Can't make it live? Register anyway for the recording."
  → Reduces friction, increases registrations
```

### Bad Promotion Copy

```
✗ "Join our webinar!"
  → No benefit, no reason to care

✗ "Don't miss this exclusive event!!!"
  → Exclamation point abuse, meaningless hype

✗ "Register now for exciting content"
  → Vague, generic, uninspiring

✗ "Only 10 spots left!" (when there's no limit)
  → Fake scarcity destroys trust
```

### LinkedIn Promotion Playbook

| Post Type | When to Use | Best Practices |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Announcement** | 4-6 weeks out | Speaker tags, event image, clear CTA |
| **Speaker feature** | 3-4 weeks out | Speaker writes post, you amplify |
| **Content teaser** | 2-3 weeks out | Share one insight, promise more |
| **Social proof** | 1-2 weeks out | Registration count, company logos |
| **Final reminder** | 1 week out | Urgency, direct ask |
| **Day-of** | Event day | Join link, live updates |

### Paid Promotion Strategy

| Platform | Best For | Targeting | Creative |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **LinkedIn** | B2B, job title targeting | Title, company, industry | Professional, clear value |
| **Meta** | Webinars, broad reach | Interest, lookalike | Visual, benefit-focused |
| **Google** | High-intent search | Industry + "conference/webinar" | Compelling headline |
| **Twitter/X** | Tech audiences | Followers of competitors, topics | Conversation-starting |

### Retargeting for Registration

| Audience | Message | Timing |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Page visitors, not registered** | "Still thinking about [Event]?" | 1-7 days |
| **Partial form fills** | "You're almost registered" | 1-3 days |
| **Past webinar attendees** | "Join us for [Related Topic]" | Immediately |
| **Customer list** | "Exclusive for customers: [Event]" | 2-4 weeks |

### Show Rate Optimization

| Tactic | Show Rate Impact | Effort |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Calendar invite with join link** | +15-20% | Low |
| **Reminder email 24 hours** | +10-15% | Low |
| **Reminder email 1 hour** | +5-10% | Low |
| **SMS reminder (with consent)** | +10-15% | Medium |
| **Pre-event content/homework** | +5-10% | Medium |
| **Live Q&A promise** | +10-15% | Low |
| **Limited replay availability** | +15-20% | Low |

### Good vs Bad Subject Lines

| Goal | Good Example | Bad Example |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Announce** | "Save the date: The Future of DevSecOps" | "Webinar Invitation" |
| **Build** | "3 things you'll learn at [Event]" | "Register Now!" |
| **Push** | "500+ engineers registered — join them" | "Don't miss out!!!" |
| **Final** | "48 hours left to register" | "Last Chance!" |
| **Remind** | "Tomorrow: Your secrets management workshop" | "Event Reminder" |

### Registration Conversion Benchmarks

| Source | Registration Rate | Quality |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Email (warm list)** | 2-5% | High |
| **Email (cold list)** | 0.5-1% | Medium |
| **LinkedIn organic** | 1-3% | Medium-High |
| **LinkedIn ads** | 0.5-2% | Medium |
| **Partner promotion** | 2-4% | Varies |
| **Paid search** | 3-8% | High |
| **Retargeting** | 5-15% | High |

### Promotional Asset Checklist

- [ ] Event landing page (optimized for conversion)
- [ ] Email series (6-8 emails, segmented)
- [ ] Social posts (LinkedIn, Twitter, 8-10 total)
- [ ] Paid ad creative (3-5 variations)
- [ ] Speaker promotional kit
- [ ] Partner/sponsor promotional assets
- [ ] Press release (for major events)
- [ ] Calendar invite template
- [ ] SMS templates (if used)

### Anti-Patterns

- **Single-channel promotion** — Email alone leaves reach on the table
- **Too early announcements** — 12 weeks out = registrations forgotten
- **Too late promotion** — Starting 2 weeks before kills registration numbers
- **No speaker leverage** — Speakers have networks you don't
- **Generic messaging** — Same copy for every audience
- **No show rate strategy** — Registration without attendance is vanity
- **Ignoring replay option** — "Live only" limits registration potential
- **Overwhelming form** — 10-field forms kill conversion
