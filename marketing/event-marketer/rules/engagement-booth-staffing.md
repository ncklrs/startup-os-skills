## Booth Staffing & Engagement

**Impact: HIGH**

Your booth staff are your event's frontline sales team. Trained staff create qualified opportunities. Untrained staff collect badges that go nowhere. The difference is millions in pipeline.

### Staffing Formula

| Booth Size | Staff Per Shift | Total (Full Day) |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **10x10** | 2-3 | 4-6 |
| **10x20** | 3-4 | 6-8 |
| **20x20** | 5-6 | 10-12 |
| **Island 30x30+** | 8-10 | 16-20 |

**Rule:** Never have empty booth + never have staff outnumbering visitors.

### Staff Role Mix

| Role | % of Staff | Responsibilities |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Booth Lead** | 10% | Schedule, logistics, escalations |
| **Demo Specialist** | 20-30% | Technical product demonstrations |
| **Conversation Starter** | 40-50% | Qualification, engagement, routing |
| **Executive Presence** | 10-20% | Strategic meetings, partnerships |
| **Support** | 10% | Lead capture, logistics, breaks |

### Shift Planning

```
Conference Day (8 hours):

Early (8am-12pm)
├── 2-3 conversation starters
├── 1 demo specialist
└── 1 booth lead

Peak (12pm-5pm)
├── 3-4 conversation starters
├── 2 demo specialists
├── 1 executive
└── 1 booth lead

Late (5pm-7pm)
├── 2 conversation starters
├── 1 demo specialist
└── 1 booth lead

Key: Overlap during transitions, max during lunch/breaks
```

### Booth Staff Training Agenda

| Session | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Event overview** | 30 min | Goals, metrics, what success looks like |
| **Messaging & positioning** | 45 min | Key messages, competitive responses |
| **Conversation framework** | 60 min | Opening, qualification, handoff |
| **Demo training** | 60 min | Which demos, when, how to personalize |
| **Lead capture** | 30 min | System, qualification criteria, notes |
| **Logistics** | 30 min | Schedule, dress code, do's and don'ts |
| **Role play** | 60 min | Practice conversations with feedback |

### Conversation Framework: OPEN

**O — Open** (5 seconds)
Make it about them, not you.

```
✓ "What brings you to the show today?"
✓ "What sessions are you checking out?"
✓ "Have you visited this event before?"

✗ "Have you heard of SecretStash?"
✗ "Want a demo?"
✗ "Can I scan your badge?"
```

**P — Probe** (60 seconds)
Qualify while showing genuine interest.

```
✓ "What tools are you using for secrets management today?"
✓ "What's your biggest security challenge right now?"
✓ "How are you handling credentials in CI/CD?"

Listen for: Pain points, current tools, timeline, authority
```

**E — Engage** (2-3 minutes)
Match their interest with relevant value.

```
If pain = sprawl: "Let me show you how Stripe manages 10k secrets..."
If pain = compliance: "Here's our SOC2 audit trail feature..."
If pain = onboarding: "Watch how fast a new engineer gets access..."

Key: Personalize based on what they shared
```

**N — Next** (30 seconds)
Clear next step based on qualification.

```
Hot lead: "Let me get my AE to schedule a deep dive next week"
Warm lead: "Can I send you a case study about [their use case]?"
Cold lead: "Here's a sticker, check out our docs at..."

Never end without a defined next step
```

### Good Booth Conversations

```
✓ Position at booth edge, facing traffic
  → Approachable, catches attention

✓ "Hi! First time at this conference?"
  → Open, friendly, no sales pressure

✓ "Interesting — so you're managing secrets across multiple clouds?"
  → Active listening, building on their response

✓ "That sounds similar to what [customer] dealt with. Want me to show you how they solved it?"
  → Social proof, relevant demo offer

✓ "Let me introduce you to our solutions engineer — she specializes in [their use case]"
  → Warm handoff, not abandon
```

### Bad Booth Conversations

```
✗ Standing behind the table, arms crossed
  → Unapproachable, defensive body language

✗ Launching into pitch before asking questions
  → Self-focused, not helpful

✗ "Want a demo?" to every passerby
  → Salesy, annoying, ineffective

✗ Talking to colleagues while ignoring visitors
  → Unwelcoming, missed opportunities

✗ "Just take some swag"
  → No qualification, no value exchange

✗ Checking phone while "manning" the booth
  → Disengaged, unprofessional
```

### Lead Qualification Criteria

| Signal | Hot | Warm | Cold |
|--------|-----|------|------|
| **Role** | Decision maker | Influencer | Individual contributor |
| **Pain** | Active problem | Recognized need | No current pain |
| **Timeline** | Within 90 days | Within 6 months | No timeline |
| **Budget** | Allocated | Under discussion | Unknown |
| **Current solution** | Competitor or DIY | Nothing formal | Happy with status quo |

### Lead Capture Best Practices

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **Quick capture** | Badge scan + 2 qualifying questions |
| **Detailed capture** | Full form for hot leads with context |
| **Notes** | Specific pain points, not generic "interested" |
| **Rating** | Hot/Warm/Cold assigned at capture |
| **Photo** | Optional: helps remember conversation |
| **Next step** | Captured in notes, not just "follow up" |

### Sample Lead Capture Notes

```
Good note:
"DevOps lead at 200-person fintech. Currently using Vault but
struggling with multi-cloud. Wants to see our Terraform integration.
Decision maker. Evaluating in Q1. Schedule demo next week."

Bad note:
"Interested in product"
"Nice guy"
"Scanned badge"
```

### Engagement Activities That Work

| Activity | Engagement Level | Lead Quality |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| **Product demo** | High | High |
| **Quick assessment quiz** | Medium | Medium |
| **Prize wheel (qualified)** | Medium | Medium |
| **Live expert Q&A** | High | High |
| **Photo booth (branded)** | Medium | Low |
| **Swag (gated)** | Low | Low |

### Engagement Activities to Avoid

| Activity | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| **Ungated swag grab** | No qualification, attracts collectors |
| **Complex games** | Time consuming, low ROI |
| **Generic raffle** | Attracts non-ICP for prize |
| **Selfie with mascot** | No qualification moment |

### Demo Best Practices

| Demo Type | When to Use | Duration |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **30-second pitch** | Passing traffic | 30 sec |
| **Quick win demo** | Qualified interest | 2-3 min |
| **Use case demo** | Specific pain expressed | 5-7 min |
| **Deep dive** | Hot lead, scheduled | 15-30 min |

### Demo Flow Framework

```
1. Confirm their context (30 sec)
   "So you're managing secrets across AWS and GCP, correct?"

2. Show the problem (30 sec)
   "Most teams in your situation face..."

3. Show the solution (2-3 min)
   "Here's how our customers handle that..."

4. Make it tangible (30 sec)
   "For your team of 50 engineers, this would mean..."

5. Clear next step (30 sec)
   "Let me set up time for a deeper technical session..."
```

### Staff Do's and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Wear comfortable shoes | Wear brand new shoes |
| Stay hydrated | Drink alcohol during shift |
| Rotate breaks | Leave booth understaffed |
| Capture leads immediately | Stack business cards to enter later |
| Know competitor responses | Trash talk competitors |
| Dress code compliant | Over/underdress for event |
| Charge devices overnight | Let lead capture device die |
| Debrief daily | Wait until post-event |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Badge harvesting** — Scanning everyone kills lead quality
- **Demo every visitor** — Wasted on unqualified traffic
- **Staff clumping** — Talking to each other, ignoring visitors
- **No conversation framework** — Everyone improvises differently
- **Shift abandonment** — Understaffed during peak, breaks during sessions
- **Qualification theater** — Asking questions but not listening
- **No lead notes** — Generic capture makes follow-up impossible
- **Swag bribery** — "Scan your badge for a t-shirt" = garbage leads
