# Competitive Strategist

Expert competitive intelligence and positioning guidance for winning in crowded markets — from research methodologies to sales enablement and everything in between.

## Philosophy

Competitive strategy isn't about copying competitors or tearing them down:

1. **Know yourself first** — You can't position against others until you know your own strengths
2. **Focus on customers, not competitors** — What they need matters more than what rivals do
3. **Be honest** — Lies and FUD destroy credibility faster than any competitor
4. **Stay current** — Markets move fast; stale intel costs deals

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `research-*` — Competitive research methodologies and intelligence gathering
- `analysis-*` — Win/loss analysis and market landscape mapping
- `battlecard-*` — Battlecard creation, structure, and maintenance
- `positioning-*` — Positioning against alternatives and differentiation
- `messaging-*` — Competitive messaging and objection handling
- `enablement-*` — Sales enablement for competitive situations
- `monitoring-*` — Competitive monitoring systems and alerts

### Competitive Positioning Matrix

| Positioning Type | When to Use | Key Approach |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Head-to-head** | You're stronger on key dimensions | Direct comparison |
| **Niche down** | Competitor owns general category | Own a specific segment |
| **Reframe** | Competitor's strength is irrelevant | Change the criteria |
| **Leapfrog** | New capability they can't match | Future-oriented vision |
| **Coexist** | Different jobs to be done | Complement, don't compete |

### Competitor Tiers

| Tier | Description | Monitoring Frequency | Depth of Analysis |
|------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Primary** | Direct competitors, same ICP | Weekly | Deep battlecards |
| **Secondary** | Adjacent solutions, partial overlap | Monthly | Overview cards |
| **Emerging** | Startups, potential disruptors | Quarterly | Watch list |
| **Alternatives** | Status quo, DIY, spreadsheets | Ongoing | Pain point mapping |

### Win/Loss Analysis Framework

```
Deal Outcome
    │
    ├── Won Against Competitor
    │   ├── What differentiated us?
    │   ├── What did they say about competitor?
    │   └── What would have changed their mind?
    │
    └── Lost to Competitor
        ├── What was the deciding factor?
        ├── Where did we fall short?
        └── What could we have done differently?
```

### The Battlecard Structure

| Section | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Overview** | Quick context, what they do | Quarterly |
| **Positioning** | How we win, key differentiators | Monthly |
| **Landmines** | Questions to ask that expose weaknesses | As discovered |
| **Objection Handling** | Responses to "Why not [competitor]?" | As encountered |
| **Proof Points** | Customer quotes, case studies | As available |
| **Pricing Intel** | Known pricing, packaging | As discovered |

## Competitive Response Spectrum

| Situation | Response | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **They launch feature you have** | Emphasize experience, depth | "We've had this for 2 years, here's what we've learned" |
| **They launch feature you don't** | Roadmap or reframe | "We're focused on X because customers told us Y matters more" |
| **They cut price** | Hold on value | "You get what you pay for — here's the TCO comparison" |
| **They spread FUD** | Correct with facts | "That's not accurate — here's the truth with proof" |
| **They announce funding** | Ignore or pivot to stability | "We've been profitable since 2019" |

## Intelligence Sources (Ranked by Value)

1. **Win/loss interviews** — First-party, high signal
2. **Sales call recordings** — Real objections, real context
3. **Customer feedback** — Why they chose you (and considered others)
4. **G2/Capterra reviews** — Volume of sentiment data
5. **LinkedIn activity** — Hiring, messaging, customer posts
6. **Job postings** — Strategic direction signals
7. **Press/funding news** — Major moves, positioning shifts
8. **Product trials** — Hands-on intel (respect ToS)

## Anti-Patterns

- **FUD tactics** — Spreading fear, uncertainty, doubt backfires
- **Obsessing over competitors** — Customer needs > competitor moves
- **Stale battlecards** — Outdated intel loses deals
- **One-size-fits-all** — Different competitors need different strategies
- **Ignoring the real competitor** — Often it's "do nothing" or spreadsheets
- **Attacking instead of differentiating** — Negative selling repels buyers
- **Hoarding intel** — Unshared intelligence is worthless
- **Copying competitors** — You become undifferentiated
