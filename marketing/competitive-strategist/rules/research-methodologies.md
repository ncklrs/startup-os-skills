## Competitive Research Methodologies

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Good competitive intelligence is systematic, ethical, and actionable. Random Google searches aren't research — they're procrastination.

### Research Source Hierarchy

| Source Type | Signal Quality | Effort | Best For |
|-------------|---------------|--------|----------|
| **Win/loss interviews** | Very High | High | Understanding buyer decisions |
| **Customer conversations** | Very High | Medium | Real-world comparisons |
| **Sales call recordings** | High | Medium | Live objections, competitor mentions |
| **G2/Capterra reviews** | High | Low | Volume sentiment analysis |
| **Product trials** | High | High | Feature verification |
| **LinkedIn monitoring** | Medium-High | Low | Hiring, messaging shifts |
| **Job postings** | Medium | Low | Strategic direction signals |
| **Press releases** | Medium | Low | Major announcements |
| **Conference talks** | Medium | Medium | Positioning, roadmap hints |
| **SEC filings** | Medium | High | Public company financials |

### Primary Research Methods

#### Win/Loss Interviews
The gold standard. Talk to people who evaluated both solutions.

```
Interview Framework:

1. Context (2 min)
   - What triggered the evaluation?
   - Who was involved in the decision?

2. Evaluation Process (5 min)
   - What alternatives did you consider?
   - What were your key criteria?
   - How did you weight those criteria?

3. Comparison (10 min)
   - How did [Competitor] compare on your top criteria?
   - What did they do well?
   - Where did they fall short?
   - What surprised you?

4. Decision (5 min)
   - What was the deciding factor?
   - Was there anything that almost changed your mind?
   - What would you tell someone else evaluating?

5. Retrospective (3 min)
   - Has your perception changed since deciding?
   - Anything you wish you'd known earlier?
```

#### Sales Team Debriefs
Your sales team is a goldmine. Extract intel systematically.

```
Weekly Debrief Questions:

- Which competitors came up this week?
- What objections did prospects raise about us?
- What claims did competitors make against us?
- What features did prospects ask about that competitors have?
- Any pricing intel surface?
```

### Secondary Research Checklist

| Research Task | Frequency | Tools/Sources |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| Review site monitoring | Weekly | G2, Capterra, TrustRadius |
| Social listening | Daily | LinkedIn, Twitter/X |
| Job posting analysis | Monthly | LinkedIn, Indeed, their careers page |
| Content audit | Monthly | Their blog, resources, webinars |
| Product updates | Weekly | Release notes, changelog |
| Pricing changes | Monthly | Their pricing page, proposals |
| News/PR monitoring | Daily | Google Alerts, Feedly |
| SEO/positioning | Monthly | Semrush, Ahrefs |

### Good Research Practices

```
✓ Primary source verification
  → Don't trust claims without evidence

✓ Multiple source triangulation
  → One review is an anecdote; patterns are insight

✓ Date and source all intel
  → "Competitor X has Y" means nothing without when/where

✓ Distinguish fact from inference
  → "They're struggling with enterprise" vs "Their reviews mention implementation issues"

✓ Regular refresh cadence
  → Set calendar reminders for research sprints
```

### Bad Research Practices

```
✗ Relying solely on competitor's marketing
  → They lie just like we do

✗ One-time research "projects"
  → Competition is continuous, not a project

✗ Hoarding intel in personal notes
  → Unshared intelligence is worthless

✗ Confirmation bias searching
  → Looking for evidence they suck misses where they excel

✗ Violating ToS or ethics
  → Fake accounts, deceptive practices destroy credibility
```

### Intelligence Quality Scoring

| Quality Level | Characteristics | Usage |
|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Verified** | Multiple sources, first-hand | Use confidently in sales |
| **Probable** | Single reliable source | Use with caveat |
| **Possible** | Inference from patterns | Internal strategy only |
| **Unverified** | Single unreliable source | Investigate further |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Analysis paralysis** — Research is for action, not perfection
- **Recency bias** — Old patterns matter as much as new news
- **Competitor obsession** — Hours researching, minutes with customers
- **Single-source dependency** — One angry review isn't a pattern
- **Ethical shortcuts** — Fake accounts, ToS violations, insider info
- **Research hoarding** — Intel in your head helps no one
