## Win/Loss Analysis Programs

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Win/loss analysis is the highest-signal competitive intelligence source. First-party data from people who actually chose between you and competitors beats everything else.

### Program Components

| Component | Description | Frequency |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **CRM Tracking** | Capture competitor and loss reason in every deal | Every deal |
| **Win Interviews** | Deep dive with customers who chose you | 10%+ of wins |
| **Loss Interviews** | Deep dive with prospects who chose competitor | 20%+ of losses |
| **Quarterly Analysis** | Pattern identification and reporting | Quarterly |
| **Stakeholder Readout** | Share insights with product, sales, marketing | Quarterly |

### Interview Best Practices

#### Timing

| Timing | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Immediately (< 2 weeks)** | Fresh memory, detailed recall | Emotion may cloud judgment |
| **30 days post-decision** | Settled perspective, implementation context | Details fade |
| **90+ days** | Can assess if decision was right | Poor recall, different person may respond |

**Recommendation:** 2-4 weeks post-decision for best balance.

#### Who Should Interview

```
Best Interviewers (in order):
1. Dedicated win/loss analyst (neutral, trained)
2. Product marketing (understands product/market)
3. Third-party firm (maximum objectivity)
4. Success team (for wins, relationship exists)

Avoid:
✗ The sales rep who lost the deal (defensive)
✗ Executive (intimidating, biased questions)
✗ Product team alone (may push for features)
```

### Good Interview Questions

```
Discovery Phase:
✓ "Walk me through how you first identified you needed a solution."
  → Understands trigger and context

✓ "Who else was involved in the evaluation?"
  → Maps buying committee

✓ "What criteria mattered most, and why?"
  → Reveals true priorities

Evaluation Phase:
✓ "How did you narrow down your options?"
  → Shows elimination criteria

✓ "What was your impression of [us/competitor] in the evaluation?"
  → Open-ended, non-leading

✓ "What did [competitor] do particularly well?"
  → Surfaces their strengths

✓ "Where did they fall short of your expectations?"
  → Surfaces their weaknesses

Decision Phase:
✓ "What was the deciding factor in your choice?"
  → Single most important insight

✓ "Was there anything that almost changed your mind?"
  → Close-call insights

✓ "What would you tell someone else evaluating these options?"
  → Summarized recommendation
```

### Bad Interview Questions

```
✗ "Why did you choose the wrong solution?"
  → Judgmental, puts them on defense

✗ "We have [feature], doesn't that matter?"
  → Leading, makes them justify

✗ "Was it price?"
  → Closed-ended, suggests answer

✗ "Don't you think [competitor] has problems with X?"
  → Leading, fishing for agreement

✗ "Would you switch if we had [feature]?"
  → Hypothetical, unreliable
```

```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Only interviewing losses** — Wins tell you what's working
- **Sales rep sole source** — They have blind spots and biases
- **No action from insights** — Analysis without change is wasted effort
- **Blaming sales for losses** — Use data to enable, not punish
- **Waiting for statistically significant samples** — Act on patterns, iterate
- **Generic "price" as loss reason** — Dig deeper, price is often proxy
- **Interviewing too late** — Memory degrades fast, interview within 30 days
