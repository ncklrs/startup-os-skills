## Competitive Claims and Response Strategies

**Impact: HIGH**

What you claim about competitors — and how you respond to their claims about you — shapes credibility. The wrong approach destroys trust faster than any competitor could.

### Claim Types and Guidelines

| Claim Type | Example | Risk Level | Guideline |
|------------|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Capability claim** | "We integrate with X, they don't" | Medium | Verify, date-stamp |
| **Performance claim** | "50% faster than [Competitor]" | High | Third-party validation |
| **Market claim** | "Fastest growing in category" | High | Cite source |
| **Customer claim** | "[Company] switched from [Competitor]" | Low | Get permission |
| **Review-based claim** | "Rated higher on G2" | Low-Medium | Link to source |
| **Negative claim** | "[Competitor] has problems with X" | Very High | Usually avoid |

### Good Competitive Claims

```
✓ Specific and verifiable
"Rated 4.8/5 on G2 with 500+ reviews (as of June 2024), vs [Competitor's] 4.2/5"
→ Cited source, dated, specific numbers

✓ Third-party validated
"Named a Leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant 2024"
→ Independent authority

✓ Customer-voiced
"'We switched from [Competitor] because of [specific reason]' — [Customer, Title]"
→ Testimonial format, permission obtained

✓ Outcome-focused
"Customers who switched from [Competitor] report 40% faster implementation"
→ About customer results, not competitor problems
```

### Bad Competitive Claims

```
✗ Unverified attacks
"[Competitor] has terrible customer support"
→ Subjective, unprovable, risky

✗ Outdated claims
"[Competitor] doesn't support X" (when they launched it 6 months ago)
→ Destroys credibility instantly

✗ Vague superlatives
"We're the best solution in the market"
→ Meaningless, every competitor says this

✗ Fear-based claims
"[Competitor] had a security breach and can't be trusted"
→ FUD tactics backfire

✗ Personal attacks
"Their CEO doesn't know what he's doing"
→ Unprofessional, potentially defamatory
```

### Response to Competitor Claims About You

| Their Claim | Response Level | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **False claim, widespread** | High | Public correction with facts |
| **False claim, limited** | Medium | Sales enablement, selective correction |
| **Exaggerated claim** | Low-Medium | Prepare balanced response |
| **True but spun negatively** | Medium | Acknowledge and reframe |
| **Old news being resurfaced** | Low | Ignore unless it gains traction |

### Response Framework

```
Step 1: Verify
- Is the claim actually false?
- Do we have evidence to counter?

Step 2: Assess Impact
- Where is it being said?
- Who is seeing it?
- Is it affecting deals?

Step 3: Decide Response
- Ignore (if low impact, limited reach)
- Enable (if sales needs it, but not public)
- Correct (if widespread and damaging)

Step 4: Execute
- Stick to facts
- Don't escalate
- Document everything
```

2. Evidence supporting it
3. Source of evidence
4. Date verified
5. Expiration (when to re-verify)
6. Legal review status

Template:

Source: Internal customer success data + 5 customer interviews

```

### When Competitors Attack

| Attack Type | Do | Don't |
|-------------|-----|-------|
| False claim in sales call | Arm sales with facts | Retaliate publicly |
| False claim on their website | Consider legal review | Ignore if it's damaging |
| False claim on review sites | Respond factually | Get emotional |
| False claim in press | Consider PR response | Escalate unnecessarily |
| Customer badmouthing | Understand root cause | Dismiss their experience |

### Claim Verification Checklist

Before making any competitive claim:

- [ ] Is it factually accurate?
- [ ] Can we prove it?
- [ ] Is the proof current (< 6 months old)?
- [ ] Have we cited the source?
- [ ] Has legal reviewed (if public)?
- [ ] Would we be comfortable if competitor showed this to their customers?
- [ ] Does it pass the "front page test"?

### The Ethics of Competitive Claims

```
Golden Rule:

Make claims you'd be comfortable defending in a joint customer call
with the competitor present.

If you wouldn't say it to their face with a customer watching,
don't say it at all.
```

### What to NEVER Do

| Action | Why It's Wrong | Consequence |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Spread unverified negative info | It's FUD | Credibility loss, potential legal |
| Attack competitor employees | It's personal | Industry reputation damage |
| Use competitor's confidential info | It's unethical/illegal | Legal action, reputation damage |
| Make claims you can't prove | It's dishonest | Credibility loss if caught |
| Ignore legitimate competitor strengths | It's dishonest | Buyers lose trust |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Scorched earth** — Attacking aggressively damages your brand too
- **Ignoring all attacks** — Some need response to protect deals
- **Emotional responses** — Calm, factual always wins
- **Racing to the bottom** — If they go low, you don't have to
- **Claim inflation** — Starting reasonable, getting more extreme over time
- **One-sided comparisons** — Showing only where you win destroys credibility
- **Undocumented claims** — Can't prove it when challenged
