## Sales Enablement for Competitive Situations

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Sales enablement bridges competitive intelligence and deal execution. The best intel is useless if sales can't access and apply it.

### Enablement Asset Hierarchy

| Asset | Purpose | Format | Access |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Battlecards** | Quick reference in live calls | 1-2 page doc | Always open |
| **Objection scripts** | Word-for-word responses | Searchable doc/wiki | Quick lookup |
| **Competitive demos** | Side-by-side comparison | Video/live demo | Before key calls |
| **Win stories** | Social proof and confidence | Case study/quote | Deal support |
| **Landmine questions** | Discovery strategy | List with context | Deal prep |
| **Kill sheets** | Deep competitive dives | Long-form doc | Strategic deals |

### Sales Training Components

| Component | Frequency | Duration | Outcome |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Competitive boot camp** | Onboarding | 2-4 hours | Foundation knowledge |
| **Competitor deep-dives** | Quarterly | 1 hour each | Primary competitor expertise |
| **Win/loss review** | Monthly | 30 minutes | Pattern recognition |
| **Objection role-play** | Bi-weekly | 30 minutes | Response fluency |
| **New intel briefing** | As needed | 15 minutes | Stay current |

### Discovery Questions for Competitive Intelligence

#### Qualification Stage

```
Goal: Understand competitive landscape early

✓ "What other solutions are you considering?"
   → Direct, often answered honestly early

✓ "How are you solving this today?"
   → Reveals status quo competitor

✓ "What prompted you to look for a solution now?"
   → Reveals trigger, possibly competitor frustration

✓ "Have you used tools like this before?"
   → Reveals experience with competitors
```

#### Evaluation Stage

```
Goal: Plant seeds, gather intel

✓ "What criteria are most important in your evaluation?"
   → Understand how they'll compare

✓ "Have you talked to [Competitor] yet? What was your impression?"
   → Direct competitor perception

✓ "What would need to be true for you to choose us?"
   → Surfaces objections before they become blockers
```

### Landmine Question Training

Teach reps to plant seeds that expose competitor weaknesses:

| Weakness | Landmine Question | How to Train |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Scalability | "What happens when you 10x your current volume?" | Role-play with answer |
| Implementation | "How long do you expect implementation to take?" | Show typical competitor timelines |
| Support | "What level of support do you need?" | Share competitor support reviews |
| Integration | "Walk me through your current tech stack" | Identify competitor gaps |
| Security | "What compliance requirements do you have?" | Know competitor certifications |

### Good Enablement Practices

```
✓ Accessible in workflow
  → Battlecards in CRM/Gong/Chorus, not buried in folders

✓ Regularly updated
  → Monthly review cadence minimum

✓ Feedback loop active
  → Reps contribute intel, not just consume

✓ Role-play exercises
  → Practice makes fluent, not perfect

✓ Win/loss stories shared
  → Real examples trump theory
```

### Bad Enablement Practices

```
✗ PDF dump on SharePoint
  → No one will find or read it

✗ One-time training
  → Knowledge decays, competitors evolve

✗ No feedback mechanism
  → Missing field intel, assets go stale

✗ Generic content
  → Not tailored to deal stage or segment

✗ Competitive bashing focus
  → Reps need to sell value, not attack
```

### Competitive Deal Strategy Framework

```
Pre-Call Prep (5 minutes):

1. Who's the competitor?
2. Where do we win against them?
3. Where do we typically lose?
4. What landmines should I plant?
5. What objections should I anticipate?

Post-Call Debrief (2 minutes):

1. Did competitor come up?
2. What did prospect say about them?
3. What objections did I handle?
4. What new intel did I learn?
5. What do I need for next call?
```

### Enablement Content Templates

#### Quick Competitive Cheat Sheet

```markdown
# vs [Competitor] — Quick Guide

We beat [Competitor] when [scenario] because [differentiator].

## 3 Things to Remember

## #1 Objection + Response
**"[Common objection]"**
→ "[Response script]"

### Measuring Enablement Effectiveness

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Win rate vs competitor | CRM data | Increasing trend |
| Battlecard usage | Content analytics | >80% access monthly |
| Intel contributions | Feedback submissions | >2 per rep per month |
| Objection resolution | Call review | Confident, accurate responses |
| Time to productive | New rep ramp | Handle competitive call by week 4 |

### Sales Team Intelligence Loop

| What Sales Provides | What PMM Provides |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Real objections heard | Scripted responses |
| Competitor pricing quotes | Pricing comparison analysis |
| New feature announcements | Battlecard updates |
| Win/loss context | Pattern analysis |
| Customer quotes | Reference coordination |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Enablement in isolation** — PMM creates, sales ignores
- **Overloaded reps** — Too much content, can't find anything
- **No reinforcement** — Train once, never revisit
- **Feature-focused training** — Missing the "how to sell" angle
- **Punishing losses** — Use data to enable, not blame
- **Static materials** — Content goes stale quickly
- **No success stories** — Theory without proof
