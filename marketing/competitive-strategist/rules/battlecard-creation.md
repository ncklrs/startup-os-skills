## Battlecard Creation and Maintenance

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Battlecards are the single most important competitive enablement asset. A great battlecard gives sales confidence. A stale or bad one costs deals.

### Battlecard Purpose

```
A battlecard answers ONE question:

"How do I win against [Competitor]?"

Everything in the card serves that purpose.
```

### Battlecard Structure

| Section | Purpose | Length | Update Frequency |
|---------|---------|--------|------------------|
| **Quick Facts** | At-a-glance context | 3-5 bullets | Quarterly |
| **Positioning** | How we win | 2-3 paragraphs | Monthly |
| **Landmines** | Questions that expose weaknesses | 5-10 questions | As discovered |
| **Objection Handling** | Responses to "why not them?" | 5-10 objections | As encountered |
| **Proof Points** | Evidence we win | 3-5 examples | As available |
| **Pricing Intel** | What we know about their pricing | Variable | As discovered |
| **Don't Say** | What backfires | 3-5 items | As learned |

### Good Battlecard Practices

```
✓ Written for the reader (sales rep), not the writer (PMM)
  → Scannable, actionable, usable in real-time

✓ Specific proof points, not vague claims
  → "Company X switched and reduced deploy time by 40%"

✓ Honest about where we lose
  → Sales needs to know when to walk away

✓ Updated regularly with new intel
  → Calendar reminder for monthly review

✓ Landmines actually work
  → Test them with reps, iterate
```

### Bad Battlecard Practices

```
✗ Feature list comparisons only
  → Features don't win deals, outcomes do

✗ Outdated information
  → "They don't have X" when they launched it 6 months ago

✗ No proof points
  → Claims without evidence are noise

✗ Written like a product brief
  → Walls of text no one reads

✗ FUD and attacks
  → "They're terrible" vs "Here's where we're better"

✗ Single version for all situations
  → Enterprise vs SMB needs different emphasis
```

### Landmine Question Formulas

| Formula | Example | Exposes |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Scale question** | "How many [units] do you handle today?" | Scalability limits |
| **Integration question** | "Which tools does this need to work with?" | Ecosystem gaps |
| **Support question** | "What level of support do you expect?" | Service limitations |
| **Security question** | "What compliance requirements do you have?" | Security gaps |
| **Timeline question** | "When do you need to be live?" | Implementation time |
| **Total cost question** | "What's your budget for implementation + year 1?" | Hidden costs |

### Good Landmines

```
✓ "How important is [capability we have, they don't]?"
  → Plants the seed before they mention competitor

✓ "What happens when [edge case we handle well]?"
  → Exposes limitations in their standard demo

✓ "Have you talked to customers who've been using it for 2+ years?"
  → Exposes newer competitors or churn issues

✓ "Who on your team will manage this day-to-day?"
  → Exposes complexity/ease of use differences
```

### Bad Landmines

```
✗ "Do you know [Competitor] had a security breach?"
  → FUD, even if true, looks desperate

✗ "Wouldn't you rather work with an established company?"
  → Too obvious, transparent sales tactic

✗ Questions you don't have a good answer to yourself
  → They might turn it around on you
```

### Maintenance Cadence

| Task | Frequency | Owner |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Full content review | Quarterly | PMM |
| Pricing/intel update | Monthly | PMM + Sales |
| New objection additions | As they come | Sales + PMM |
| Proof point refresh | Monthly | PMM |
| Stakeholder feedback | Quarterly | PMM |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Battlecard graveyard** — Created once, never updated
- **PMM in a vacuum** — No sales input = unusable cards
- **Feature obsession** — Leads with features not buyer outcomes
- **Competitor bashing** — Tone matters, stay professional
- **Too long** — If sales can't scan it in 2 min, they won't use it
- **Generic everything** — Same card for all segments/personas
