## Market Landscape Mapping

**Impact: HIGH**

A market landscape map helps everyone — product, sales, marketing, leadership — understand where you fit and who you're really competing against. It's your strategic context.

### Types of Market Maps

| Map Type | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Competitor Grid** | Direct comparison on key dimensions | Sales enablement, positioning |
| **Market Quadrant** | Show category leadership | Marketing, analyst relations |
| **Ecosystem Map** | Show integrations/partners | Platform positioning |
| **Category Evolution** | Show market maturity | Strategy, investor discussions |
| **Alternative Landscape** | Show all options (including status quo) | Full competitive picture |

### Competitor Grid Framework

```
                    ENTERPRISE
                        │
                        │
           ┌────────────┼────────────┐
           │            │            │
           │  [Comp A]  │  [You]     │
           │            │            │
SPECIALIZED ├────────────┼────────────┤ COMPREHENSIVE
           │            │            │
           │  [Comp B]  │  [Comp C]  │
           │            │            │
           └────────────┼────────────┘
                        │
                        │
                      SMB
```

### Good Grid Dimensions

| Dimension | Opposite | What It Shows |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Enterprise | SMB | Market segment focus |
| Specialized | Comprehensive | Feature breadth |
| Self-serve | High-touch | GTM motion |
| Modern | Legacy | Technology approach |
| Platform | Point solution | Integration strategy |
| Vertical-focused | Horizontal | Industry specificity |
| Developer-first | Business-user | Buyer persona |

### Choosing Your Axes

```
Good axis selection:

✓ Reflects dimensions buyers actually care about
✓ Puts you in a favorable (but honest) position
✓ Differentiates the field (not all competitors in one quadrant)
✓ Aligns with your positioning strategy

Bad axis selection:

✗ Arbitrary dimensions no one evaluates on
✗ Dimensions where you obviously lose
✗ Dimensions that put all competitors in same spot
✗ Technical dimensions buyers don't understand
```

### Competitor Tier Classification

| Tier | Criteria | Analysis Depth | Example |
|------|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Primary** | Same ICP, direct replacement | Deep battlecard, weekly monitoring | Direct competitor |
| **Secondary** | Overlapping ICP, partial solution | Light battlecard, monthly monitoring | Adjacent player |
| **Emerging** | New entrant, potential threat | Watch list, quarterly review | Funded startup |
| **Substitute** | Different approach, same job | Pain point comparison | DIY/spreadsheets |
| **Legacy** | Incumbent being displaced | Modernization angle | Old-school vendor |

### Good Market Map

## [Category] Market Landscape

### Map (2x2)

[Visual grid with clear axes and all relevant players positioned]

### Our Position

We've positioned in the [quadrant] because:
1. [Strategic reason 1]
2. [Strategic reason 2]

### Competitor Breakdown

| Competitor | Tier | Position | Key Differentiator |
|------------|------|----------|-------------------|
| [Comp A] | Primary | Upper left | [What they're known for] |
| [Comp B] | Secondary | Lower right | [What they're known for] |

### White Space Opportunities

Based on this analysis:
1. [Underserved segment or need]
2. [Gap no one is addressing]

### Map Caveats

- [Competitor X] is moving toward [direction]
- [New category definition] may emerge
```

### Bad Market Map

```
✗ Puts you in the "best" quadrant with no justification
  → Looks like propaganda, loses credibility

✗ Positions competitors unfairly
  → "They're legacy" when they've modernized

✗ Includes every company ever
  → Cluttered, no useful signal

✗ Uses internal jargon for axes
  → "API-first vs Config-driven" means nothing to most buyers

✗ Static document never updated
  → Markets shift, maps should too
```

### Alternative Landscape Template

## What Buyers Actually Consider

When evaluating [our category], buyers typically consider:

### 1. Do Nothing / Status Quo
- **What it means:** Continue with current process
- **Why they choose it:** No budget, no urgency, low pain
- **How to compete:** Quantify cost of inaction

### 2. DIY / Build It Internally
- **What it means:** Build custom solution
- **Why they choose it:** Control, budget constraints
- **How to compete:** Show TCO, maintenance burden, opportunity cost

### 3. Adjacent Tools (Spreadsheets, etc.)
- **What it means:** Misuse existing tools
- **Why they choose it:** Already have it, feels free
- **How to compete:** Show limitations, security risks

### 4. Point Solutions
- **What it means:** Single-purpose competitor tools
- **Why they choose it:** Lower cost, simpler
- **How to compete:** Show value of integration, completeness

### 5. Platform Solutions
- **What it means:** Part of larger vendor suite
- **Why they choose it:** Existing relationship, bundle pricing

```

### Ecosystem Map Components

| Component | What to Include |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Core product** | Your solution (center) |
| **Integrations** | Tools you connect with |
| **Partners** | Implementation, reseller, tech partners |
| **Competitors** | Positioned relative to you |
| **Data sources** | Where data flows from |
| **Data destinations** | Where data flows to |

### Market Map Maintenance

| Task | Frequency | Trigger |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Full redraw | Annually | Category shift, rebrand |
| Competitor position update | Quarterly | Funding, acquisition, pivot |
| New player addition | As needed | Notable new entrant |
| Axis reconsideration | Annually | Market evolution |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Self-serving positioning** — Designing axes where only you win
- **Analysis paralysis** — Perfecting the map instead of using it
- **Ignoring alternatives** — Competitors aren't just other vendors
- **One map for all audiences** — Analysts need different view than sales
- **Static thinking** — Markets move, maps should reflect direction
- **Crowded visuals** — Too many logos, no clear story
