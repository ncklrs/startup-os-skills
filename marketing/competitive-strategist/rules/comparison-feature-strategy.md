## Feature Comparison Strategies

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Feature comparisons are high-stakes content. Done well, they accelerate deals. Done poorly, they destroy credibility or invite lawsuits.

### Comparison Content Types

| Type | Use Case | Risk Level | Legal Review |
|------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Internal matrix** | Sales reference | Low | Recommended |
| **Public comparison page** | SEO, buyer research | High | Required |
| **Demo comparison** | Live selling | Medium | Recommended |
| **RFP response** | Formal evaluation | High | Required |
| **G2/review site claim** | Marketing | Medium | Required |

### The Honest Comparison Framework

```
1. Be accurate — Verify every claim
2. Be current — Check quarterly minimum
3. Be fair — Include their strengths too
4. Be specific — Vague comparisons invite challenges
5. Be provable — "Faster" needs benchmarks
```

### Good Comparison Table Structure

| Capability | You | Competitor | Why It Matters |
|------------|-----|------------|----------------|
| [Capability 1] | ✓ Full support | ✓ Partial | [Explanation] |
| [Capability 2] | ✓ Native | ✗ Via integration | [Explanation] |

Why this is bad:

- No specifics
- No "last updated" date
- No acknowledgment of competitor strengths
- Could invite legal action
- Destroys credibility with savvy buyers
```

### Legal Considerations

| Claim Type | Risk | How to Handle |
|------------|------|---------------|
| **Performance benchmarks** | Medium | Use third-party or documented methodology |
| **Feature availability** | Low | Verify and date-stamp |
| **Pricing** | Medium | Note "as of [date]" and "per public pricing" |
| **Customer quotes** | Low | Get written permission |
| **Market position claims** | High | Cite source (Gartner, G2, etc.) |
| **Subjective comparisons** | Low-Medium | Frame as opinion, not fact |

### Language Guidelines

| Don't Say | Say Instead | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| "[Competitor] is bad at X" | "We approach X differently by..." | Avoids defamation risk |
| "[Competitor] doesn't have X" | "As of [date], [Competitor's] public documentation doesn't include X" | Accuracy with caveat |
| "[Competitor] is expensive" | "[Competitor] pricing starts at $X for Y" | Factual, not judgmental |
| "Everyone is switching from [Competitor]" | "We've welcomed X customers from [Competitor] this year" | Specific and provable |
| "[Competitor] has security issues" | "We offer [security feature] that [description]" | Focus on your strength |

### Feature Comparison Categories

| Category | What to Compare | Example Dimensions |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Core functionality** | The main job to be done | Breadth, depth, quality |
| **Integrations** | Ecosystem connectivity | Number, depth, native vs third-party |
| **Scalability** | Growth handling | Limits, performance at scale |
| **Security** | Protection and compliance | Certifications, features, architecture |
| **Ease of use** | User experience | Time to value, learning curve |
| **Support** | Help and service | Channels, response time, coverage |
| **Pricing** | Total cost | Model, transparency, value |

### Good Feature Claims

```
✓ "Sub-100ms average API response time (measured across 1M requests in June 2024)"
  → Specific, measurable, dated

✓ "Rated 4.8/5 on G2 for ease of use (as of Q2 2024, 500+ reviews)"
  → Third-party validation, cited

✓ "Native integrations with 50+ tools including [list top 5]"
  → Specific number, examples

✓ "SOC 2 Type II certified since 2022"
  → Verifiable, dated
```

### Bad Feature Claims

```
✗ "Fastest in the market"
  → Unsubstantiated superlative

✗ "Better support than anyone else"
  → Subjective, unprovable

✗ "More features than competitors"
  → Vague, which features? which competitors?

✗ "Enterprise-grade security"
  → Meaningless buzzword
```

### Comparison Update Process

| Task | Frequency | Owner | Verification |
|------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Accuracy check | Monthly | PMM | Review competitor docs/product |
| Date stamp update | Quarterly | PMM | Add "Last verified: [date]" |
| Customer quote refresh | Quarterly | PMM | Check permission still valid |
| Legal review | Annually | Legal | Full page review |
| Competitive landscape changes | As needed | PMM | Monitor competitor releases |

### Handling Competitor Claims About You

```
When competitors make false claims:

1. Document the claim (screenshot, URL, date)
2. Prepare factual correction
3. Decide response level:
   - Ignore (if obscure/irrelevant)
   - Correct privately (if sales team needs it)
   - Correct publicly (if widespread)
   - Legal action (if defamatory and damaging)

Response template:
"[Competitor] has stated [claim]. Here's the accurate information:
[facts with evidence]. We've documented this at [URL] and are happy
to discuss with any customer who has questions."
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Outdated comparisons** — Claiming they lack features they've since added
- **Cherry-picking** — Showing only dimensions you win on
- **Ignoring their strengths** — Makes you look dishonest
- **Unverifiable claims** — "We're faster" with no benchmarks
- **Legal landmines** — Claims that could trigger C&D letters
- **Feature-only focus** — Features don't tell the whole story
- **Set and forget** — Competitors change, comparisons must too
