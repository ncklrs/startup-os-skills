## QBR Program Design

**Impact: CRITICAL**

A well-designed QBR program transforms routine customer check-ins into strategic partnership moments. The best QBR programs are segmented, scalable, and systematically drive business outcomes. 65% of customer executives say their vendor QBRs waste their time — be in the 35%.

### QBR Cadence by Segment

| Segment | ARR Range | Review Type | Frequency | Duration | Exec Presence |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Strategic** | $500K+ | Executive Business Review | Quarterly | 90-120 min | C-level required |
| **Enterprise** | $100K-$500K | Quarterly Business Review | Quarterly | 60-90 min | VP/Director |
| **Mid-Market** | $25K-$100K | Business Review | Semi-annual | 45-60 min | Manager/Director |
| **SMB** | $5K-$25K | Success Review | Annual | 30-45 min | Primary contact |
| **Tech-Touch** | <$5K | Digital Review | Annual | Async/self-serve | Automated |

### QBR vs EBR: When to Elevate

| Criteria | Standard QBR | Executive Business Review (EBR) |
|----------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Account Value** | <$250K ARR | >$250K ARR |
| **Strategic Importance** | Standard | Strategic/Logo account |
| **Expansion Potential** | Moderate | Significant |
| **Executive Access** | Director level | VP/C-level access |
| **Risk Level** | Low-Medium | At-risk or critical |
| **Partnership Depth** | Vendor relationship | Strategic partnership |
| **Internal Escalation** | CSM-led | CS Leadership + exec sponsor |

### Good QBR Program Design

```
✓ Segmented approach
  → Different programs for different tiers
  → Strategic accounts get executive investment
  → SMB gets efficient, digital-first reviews
  → Resource allocation matches account value

✓ Clear governance
  → Defined cadence by segment
  → Escalation paths established
  → Quality standards documented
  → Executive sponsor program

✓ Systematic preparation
  → Standard timeline (2 weeks prep minimum)
  → Checklist-driven preparation
  → Data gathering automated where possible
  → Pre-QBR alignment call scheduled

✓ Customer-centric scheduling
  → Aligned to customer fiscal calendar
  → Avoids customer busy periods
  → Renewal timing considered
  → Multi-meeting approach for complex reviews

✓ Measured outcomes
  → QBR effectiveness tracked
  → Action completion rates monitored
  → Customer satisfaction surveyed
  → Continuous improvement applied
```

### Bad QBR Program Design

```
✗ One-size-fits-all approach
  → Same 60-slide deck for $20K and $500K accounts
  → Identical cadence regardless of value
  → No executive involvement differentiation

✗ Internal-centric scheduling
  → "Let's schedule all QBRs in the last week of quarter"
  → Vendor convenience over customer needs
  → Rush through back-to-back reviews

✗ Reactive, not programmatic
  → QBRs only when customer complains
  → No established cadence
  → Ad hoc preparation

✗ No governance or standards
  → Every CSM does it differently
  → No quality baseline
  → No executive oversight

✗ Presentation over conversation
  → 90 minutes of vendor talking
  → No customer input designed in
  → PowerPoint theater
```

### QBR Program Governance Framework

| Governance Element | Description | Owner | Frequency |
|--------------------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| **Program Standards** | Template, duration, content requirements | CS Ops | Annual review |
| **Quality Review** | Random QBR audits, feedback | CS Leadership | Monthly |
| **Training** | QBR skills development | Enablement | Quarterly |
| **Executive Alignment** | Review exec engagement metrics | CS VP | Quarterly |
| **Customer Feedback** | Post-QBR surveys, analysis | CS Ops | Ongoing |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Program optimization | CS Ops | Quarterly |

### QBR Calendar Planning

```
## Annual QBR Calendar Template

Q1 (Jan-Mar)
├── Strategic Accounts: Jan-Feb (avoid fiscal year-end)
├── Enterprise: Feb-Mar (post-holiday)
├── Mid-Market: Feb (semi-annual cohort A)
└── SMB: Mar (annual reviews begin)

Q2 (Apr-Jun)
├── Strategic Accounts: Apr-May
├── Enterprise: Apr-May
├── Mid-Market: N/A (semi-annual)
└── SMB: Apr-May (annual cohort B)

Q3 (Jul-Sep)
├── Strategic Accounts: Jul-Aug (avoid summer vacations)
├── Enterprise: Aug-Sep
├── Mid-Market: Aug (semi-annual cohort A)
└── SMB: Sep (annual cohort C)

Q4 (Oct-Dec)
├── Strategic Accounts: Oct-Nov (pre-planning season)
├── Enterprise: Oct-Nov
├── Mid-Market: Nov (semi-annual cohort B)
└── SMB: Nov (annual cohort D)
└── Note: Avoid Dec for all segments
```

### QBR Timing Considerations

| Factor | Timing Recommendation | Rationale |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Renewal proximity** | 90-120 days before | Influence renewal decision |
| **Fiscal year-end** | Avoid last month | Customer distracted |
| **Budget planning** | Q4 or 60 days before | Influence next year spend |
| **Product launches** | 30 days after | New value to discuss |
| **Executive changes** | Within 30 days | Build new relationships |
| **Major milestones** | Within 2 weeks | Celebrate and document |

### QBR Program Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target | Measurement |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------|
| **QBR Completion Rate** | Completed / Scheduled | 90%+ | Quarterly |
| **Executive Attendance** | QBRs with exec present | 80%+ | Per QBR |
| **Customer Preparation** | Customer submits input | 70%+ | Per QBR |
| **On-Time Delivery** | Within cadence window | 85%+ | Quarterly |
| **Action Completion** | Actions completed by next QBR | 80%+ | Per QBR |
| **Customer Satisfaction** | Post-QBR survey score | 4.5/5+ | Per QBR |
| **Expansion Correlation** | QBRs to expansion rate | Track trend | Quarterly |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Calendar cramming** — All QBRs in last week of quarter
- **Template tyranny** — Same rigid deck regardless of context
- **Executive absence** — No leadership involvement in strategic accounts
- **Measurement void** — No tracking of QBR effectiveness
- **Preparation vacuum** — CSMs wing it without systematic prep
- **Customer irrelevance** — Vendor metrics, not customer outcomes
- **Static program** — No evolution based on feedback
- **Inconsistent quality** — Wild variation between CSMs
