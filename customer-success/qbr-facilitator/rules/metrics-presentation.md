## Success Metrics Presentation

**Impact: HIGH**

Metrics tell your story, but only if you tell them right. Executives are drowning in data — your job is to surface the metrics that matter and present them in a way that drives understanding and action. 10 meaningful metrics beats 100 data points.

### The Metrics Hierarchy for QBRs

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LEVEL 1: BUSINESS OUTCOMES (Show first)                        │
│  Revenue impact, cost savings, strategic goals achieved         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LEVEL 2: LEADING INDICATORS (Show second)                      │
│  Health score, adoption trends, engagement patterns             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LEVEL 3: OPERATIONAL METRICS (Reference/appendix)              │
│  Usage data, support tickets, feature adoption                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LEVEL 4: TECHNICAL METRICS (Only if asked)                     │
│  Uptime, performance, API calls                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Metrics Selection by Executive Level

| Audience | Metrics to Show | Metrics to Skip |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **C-Suite** | ROI, NRR, strategic impact | Feature adoption details |
| **VP Level** | Departmental KPIs, trends | Technical performance |
| **Director** | Team metrics, adoption, efficiency | API call volumes |
| **Manager** | Usage, features, support | Industry benchmarks |

### Good Metrics Presentation

```
✓ Context before numbers
  → "Your goal was to reduce churn by 20%..."
  → "Here's how you're tracking..."

✓ Trend over snapshot
  → Show 4 quarters, not just this quarter
  → Progress and trajectory matter

✓ Benchmark when relevant
  → "You're in the top 20% of similar companies"
  → Peer comparison adds context

✓ Story, not spreadsheet
  → Lead with insight: "Here's what the data tells us..."
  → Numbers support the narrative

✓ Visual hierarchy
  → Most important metrics largest/first
  → Supporting data smaller/secondary
  → Technical data in appendix

✓ Call out the "so what"
  → "This 15% improvement means $200K in savings"
  → Always translate to impact
```

### Bad Metrics Presentation

```
✗ Data dump approach
  → 50 slides of usage charts
  → No hierarchy or prioritization
  → Executive eyes glaze over

✗ Vanity metrics first
  → "You had 14,523 logins!"
  → "278 API calls this month!"
  → Impressive numbers, zero insight

✗ Snapshot without trend
  → "Your adoption is 67%"
  → Is that up? Down? Good? Bad?
  → No context = no meaning

✗ Technical audience assumption
  → Deep performance metrics for business execs
  → API response times for the CEO
  → Know your audience

✗ Numbers without narrative
  → Slide after slide of charts
  → No interpretation or insight
  → Customer left to figure it out
```

### Benchmarking Framework

| Benchmark Type | Use Case | Example |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| **Peer Benchmark** | Similar customers | "Top 20% of enterprise customers" |
| **Industry Benchmark** | Vertical comparison | "Healthcare average is 65%" |
| **Historical** | Customer's own progress | "Up 23% from Q1" |
| **Goal Benchmark** | vs stated objectives | "87% toward your 90% goal" |
| **Best Practice** | Ideal state | "Top performers achieve 85%+" |

### Benchmark Presentation Examples

```
## Effective Benchmark Framing

✓ Positive framing with aspiration:
  "Your adoption rate of 78% puts you in the top quartile.
   Our most successful customers typically hit 85%+,
   which is within reach with these three actions..."

✓ Honest with path forward:
  "Your current engagement score of 62 is below the
   benchmark of 70. However, I've seen similar customers
   improve 15+ points in one quarter by focusing on..."

✗ Negative comparison without help:
  "You're below benchmark."
  (No context, no path forward, just bad news)

✗ Manipulative benchmarking:
  "You're in the top 5%!" (of a cherry-picked metric)
  (Loses credibility when customer investigates)
```

### Data Visualization Best Practices

| Chart Type | Best For | Avoid When |
|------------|----------|------------|
| **Line Chart** | Trends over time | Comparing categories |
| **Bar Chart** | Comparing categories | Too many categories (>7) |
| **Pie Chart** | Part-to-whole (2-4 segments) | Many segments, trends |
| **Gauge/Score** | Single KPI status | Detailed breakdown needed |
| **Table** | Precise numbers, comparisons | Visual story needed |
| **Heatmap** | Multi-dimensional comparison | Simple comparisons |

### Common Metrics Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too many metrics | Overwhelms, dilutes focus | Curate to 5-7 key metrics |
| No trend data | No context for current state | Always show trajectory |
| Unlabeled axes | Confusing charts | Clear labels, units |
| Missing baselines | Can't show improvement | Establish at onboarding |
| Inconsistent timeframes | Apples to oranges | Standardize periods |
| Hidden bad news | Erodes trust | Address proactively |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Metric overload** — Drowning executives in data
- **Vanity metric focus** — Logins over outcomes
- **Snapshot syndrome** — No trends or context
- **Cherry-picking** — Showing only good news
- **Technical metrics for executives** — API calls for the CEO
- **No benchmarks** — Numbers without reference points
- **Missing the "so what"** — Data without insight
- **Inconsistent presentation** — Different format each QBR
