## Value Demonstration

**Impact: CRITICAL**

The QBR is your opportunity to prove ROI and justify the customer's investment. If you can't quantify value, you become a cost to cut. The best CSMs transform usage data into compelling business impact narratives that executives remember.

### The Value Pyramid

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    STRATEGIC VALUE                               │
│    Market position, competitive advantage, innovation           │
│    "You're now 2 years ahead of competitors in X"               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    BUSINESS VALUE                                │

### ROI Calculation Framework

| Value Type | Formula | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Time Savings** | Hours saved × Hourly rate | 100 hrs × $75 = $7,500 |
| **Revenue Impact** | Attributed revenue × Win rate | $500K × 30% = $150K |
| **Cost Reduction** | Previous cost - New cost | $200K - $140K = $60K savings |
| **Risk Avoidance** | Incident cost × Incidents avoided | $50K × 4 = $200K avoided |
| **Quality Improvement** | Error cost × Reduction % | $100K × 60% = $60K saved |

### Good Value Demonstration

```
✓ Business outcomes, not features
  → "You reduced customer churn by 23%"
  → Not "You used the churn prediction feature 45 times"

✓ Customer's own metrics
  → "Your NPS increased from 32 to 48"
  → Not "Industry NPS average is 35"

✓ Before/after comparison
  → "Before: 4 hours per report. Now: 15 minutes"
  → Baseline established at onboarding

✓ Dollar quantification
  → "3,400 hours saved = $255,000 in productivity"
  → Always translate to business value

✓ Executive language
  → Revenue, margin, risk, market position
  → Not features, clicks, logins

✓ Attribution clarity
  → "This improvement is directly tied to your use of X"
  → Connect value to your solution specifically
```

### Bad Value Demonstration

```
✗ Vanity metrics only
  → "You had 14,000 logins this quarter!"
  → Logins ≠ Value

✗ Feature usage reports
  → "Here's every feature and how often you used it"
  → Usage ≠ Outcomes

✗ Vendor-centric metrics
  → "We achieved 99.9% uptime"
  → What does uptime mean to THEIR business?

✗ Unquantified claims
  → "You're more efficient now"
  → How much more efficient? In dollars?

✗ Generic benchmarks
  → "Industry average is X"
  → What's THEIR specific improvement?

✗ Past-only focus
  → "Here's what happened last quarter"
  → So what? What's next?
```

### Value Story Structure

```
## The IMPACT Value Story Framework

I - Identify the business challenge
    "Before implementing [Solution], your team was..."

M - Measure the baseline
    "Specifically, you were spending [X hours/dollars] on..."

P - Present the solution
    "With [Solution], you implemented [specific capability]..."

A - Articulate the improvement
    "As a result, you've achieved [specific metric improvement]..."

C - Calculate the ROI
    "This translates to [$X value] in [timeframe]..."

T - Tie to strategic goals
    "This directly supports your initiative to [strategic goal]..."
```

### Value Story Example

```
## Value Story: Acme Corp - Customer Support Efficiency

IDENTIFY:
"When we started working together, Acme's support team was
struggling with high ticket volumes and slow resolution times,
impacting customer satisfaction and agent burnout."

MEASURE:
"Specifically, you were handling 2,400 tickets/month with an
average resolution time of 48 hours and a CSAT of 3.2/5."

PRESENT:
"Using our AI-powered ticket routing and knowledge base
automation, your team implemented smart triage and
self-service deflection."

ARTICULATE:
"Over the past quarter, you've reduced resolution time to
18 hours (62% improvement), increased CSAT to 4.4/5, and
deflected 35% of tickets to self-service."

CALCULATE:
"This translates to:
- 840 hours saved in agent time = $42,000/quarter
- 35% ticket deflection = $28,000 in avoided costs
- Total quarterly value: $70,000 (280% ROI on investment)"

TIE:
"This directly supports your 2024 goal of improving customer
experience while controlling support costs as you scale."

### Value Categories by Persona

| Persona | Value Focus | Key Metrics | Language |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **CEO** | Strategic positioning | Market share, growth rate | "Competitive advantage" |
| **CFO** | Financial impact | ROI, cost reduction | "Return on investment" |
| **COO** | Operational efficiency | Productivity, throughput | "Operational excellence" |
| **CTO** | Technical performance | Speed, reliability | "Technical capabilities" |
| **VP Sales** | Revenue enablement | Pipeline, win rate | "Revenue acceleration" |
| **VP Marketing** | Demand generation | Leads, conversion | "Marketing efficiency" |
| **VP CS** | Customer outcomes | NRR, CSAT | "Customer success" |

### Value Documentation Best Practices

| Practice | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Baseline at onboarding** | Capture starting metrics | "Day 1: 4 hr resolution time" |
| **Milestone tracking** | Document value at checkpoints | "Month 3: 2.5 hr resolution" |
| **Customer validation** | Have customer confirm values | "Would you agree this is accurate?" |
| **Conservative estimates** | Understate rather than overstate | "At minimum $50K, likely higher" |
| **Multi-dimensional** | Show different value types | Time + Cost + Quality + Strategic |
| **Trend analysis** | Show improvement over time | Quarter-over-quarter growth |

### Handling "We Can't Measure That"

| Customer Objection | Response Strategy |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| "We don't track that metric" | Offer proxy metrics or estimates |
| "It's hard to attribute" | Use conservative partial attribution |
| "We haven't seen impact yet" | Show leading indicators, set expectations |
| "The impact is qualitative" | Translate qualitative to quantitative |
| "Our baseline was unclear" | Establish baseline now, measure forward |

### Value Storytelling Techniques

```
## Techniques for Compelling Value Stories

1. CONTRAST
   "Before: [painful state]. After: [improved state]"
   Creates emotional impact through comparison

2. SPECIFICITY
   "3,427 hours" not "thousands of hours"
   Specific numbers are more credible

3. PERSONALIZATION
   "Your team of 12 engineers each saved 8 hours/week"
   Make it about their people

4. MOMENTUM
   "Q1: $40K value. Q2: $58K value. Q3: $82K value"
   Show accelerating returns

5. PEER COMPARISON
   "Your adoption is in the top 20% of customers your size"
   Competitive motivation

6. RISK FRAMING
   "You avoided 4 major incidents worth $200K each"
   Loss aversion is powerful
```

### Value Realization Tracking

| Milestone | Timing | Value Checkpoint |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Onboarding Complete** | Day 30-90 | Baseline established |
| **First Value** | Day 60-120 | Initial value documented |
| **QBR 1** | Day 90-120 | Value story drafted |
| **Adoption Complete** | Day 120-180 | Full value potential assessed |
| **QBR 2** | Day 180-210 | Value trend established |
| **Renewal Prep** | Day 270+ | Full ROI documented |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Vanity metric obsession** — Reporting logins, not outcomes
- **Unsubstantiated claims** — "You're more efficient" without numbers
- **Vendor-centric value** — Our metrics, not their impact
- **Past-only narrative** — What happened, not what it means
- **Single dimension** — Only cost savings, missing strategic value
- **Inflated claims** — Overclaiming destroys credibility
- **No customer validation** — Assuming they agree with your math
- **Static value story** — Same story every QBR
