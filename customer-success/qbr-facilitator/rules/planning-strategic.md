## Strategic Account Planning

**Impact: HIGH**

The QBR is the premier moment for strategic account planning. It's where you align on goals, co-create the path forward, and secure commitment to mutual success. A QBR without a forward-looking plan is just a history lesson.

### Good Strategic Planning

```
✓ Customer-driven objectives
  → "What are YOUR goals for next quarter?"
  → Their strategy, not your quota
  → Aligned to their business priorities

✓ Measurable success criteria
  → "We'll know we've succeeded when..."
  → Specific, quantifiable targets
  → Agreed upon jointly

✓ Mutual accountability
  → Customer actions + Vendor actions
  → Named owners on both sides
  → Regular progress checkpoints

✓ Multi-horizon view
  → This quarter's goals
  → This year's objectives
  → Long-term vision alignment

✓ Documented and shared
  → Written success plan
  → Accessible to all stakeholders
  → Updated each QBR

✓ Connected to value
  → Goals tied to outcomes
  → Success = business impact
  → Not just feature adoption
```

### Bad Strategic Planning

```
✗ Vendor-driven agenda
  → "Here's what WE want you to do next quarter"
  → Pushing features they don't need
  → Sales quota disguised as planning

✗ Vague objectives
  → "Improve adoption"
  → "Increase usage"
  → No measurable criteria

✗ One-sided planning
  → All customer actions, no vendor commitments
  → Or all vendor promises, no customer investment

✗ Absent documentation
  → Plans discussed but not written
  → Lost by next QBR
  → No accountability

✗ Disconnected from business
  → Feature goals, not business outcomes
  → "Use X feature" vs "Achieve Y result"

✗ Static plans
  → Same plan quarter after quarter
  → No adaptation to changing needs
```

### Goal-Setting Framework for QBRs

| Goal Category | Examples | Measurement |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| **Adoption Goals** | X% user activation, Y features adopted | Usage analytics |
| **Efficiency Goals** | Z hours/$ saved per month | Time/cost tracking |
| **Quality Goals** | Error rate reduced by X% | Quality metrics |
| **Revenue Goals** | $X attributed pipeline | CRM data |
| **Strategic Goals** | Launch in new market | Milestone achieved |

### Strategic Conversation Questions

```
## Discovery Questions for Planning

VISION & DIRECTION
- "What's your team's/company's vision for the next 12-24 months?"
- "What major initiatives are on the roadmap?"
- "How does our solution fit into that vision?"

PRIORITIES
- "What are your top 3 priorities for next quarter?"
- "What would make this quarter a success for you?"
- "What's keeping you up at night?"

CHALLENGES
- "What obstacles do you see to achieving these goals?"
- "Where are the current gaps we should address?"
- "What's been harder than expected?"

EXPANSION
- "Are there other teams that could benefit from similar outcomes?"
- "What adjacent problems are you trying to solve?"
- "How do you see our partnership evolving?"

VALUE
- "How do you measure success for this investment?"
- "What would make the ROI undeniable?"
- "What would justify expanding our partnership?"
