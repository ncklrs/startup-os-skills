## Meeting Facilitation Techniques

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

A QBR is a conversation, not a presentation. The best CSMs facilitate strategic dialogue that leaves executives feeling heard, informed, and confident. Facilitation skills separate good QBRs from great ones — and often determine whether you get the next one.

### QBR Facilitation Principles

│                   FACILITATION PRINCIPLES                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. LISTEN MORE THAN TALK                                        │
│     Target: Customer speaks 40-50% of time                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. QUESTIONS OVER STATEMENTS                                    │
│     Lead with inquiry, follow with information                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. FLEXIBLE WITHIN STRUCTURE                                    │
│     Have an agenda, but follow the conversation                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  4. EVERY MINUTE MUST EARN ITS PLACE                            │
│     Executive time is precious — make it count                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  5. END WITH ACTION, NOT INFORMATION                            │
│     Close with commitments, not just insights                    │

### Time Allocation Guide

| QBR Section | Allocation | Talking Ratio |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Opening** | 5-10% | CSM 70% / Customer 30% |
| **Customer Update** | 15-20% | Customer 80% / CSM 20% |
| **Value Review** | 20-25% | CSM 60% / Customer 40% |

### Good Facilitation Practices

```
✓ Open with alignment
  → "Before we dive in, I want to make sure we cover
     what's most important to you..."
  → Confirm agenda matches their needs
  → Be willing to adjust on the fly

✓ Ask, then tell
  → "How are you feeling about X?"
  → Listen to their perspective
  → THEN share your data/insights

✓ Create space for honesty
  → "I'd really value your candid feedback..."
  → Don't interrupt or get defensive
  → Thank them for directness

✓ Summarize and confirm
  → "What I'm hearing is..."
  → Ensure understanding
  → Give them chance to correct

✓ Manage time actively
  → "We have 10 minutes on this topic..."
  → Keep energy high, move efficiently
  → Don't let one topic consume all time

✓ End with clear commitments
  → "So our next steps are..."
  → Named owners, specific dates
  → Mutual accountability
```

### Bad Facilitation Practices

```
✗ Monologue mode
  → CSM talks for 50 straight minutes
  → Customer barely speaks
  → Not a conversation, a lecture

✗ Rigid agenda adherence
  → "We need to stay on agenda"
  → Customer wants to discuss something else
  → Misses what matters to them

✗ Death by PowerPoint
  → Click through 50 slides
  → Reading slides aloud
  → No discussion, no engagement

✗ Question dodging
  → Deflecting difficult questions
  → "Let me get back to you on that"
  → Erodes confidence

✗ Time blindness
  → Running over scheduled time
  → Executive leaves early
  → Rushing key topics at end

✗ Weak closing
  → "Any questions?"
  → No clear next steps
  → Meeting ends without commitments
```

### Opening Techniques

```
## Strong QBR Openings

ALIGNMENT OPENER
"Thanks for making time for our quarterly review. Before we
dive in, I want to make sure we focus on what matters most
to you. Looking at our agenda, is there anything you'd like
to prioritize or add?"

HEADLINE OPENER
"I have three key things I want you to take away from today:
[one], [two], and [three]. Does that align with what you're
hoping to discuss?"

CUSTOMER-FIRST OPENER
"Before I share anything, I'd love to hear what's top of
mind for you. What's been happening since we last met?"

CELEBRATION OPENER
"I want to start by celebrating — [specific achievement].
Congratulations to you and your team."

AVOID
✗ "Let me just share my screen and we'll get started..."
✗ Starting without confirming attendees/agenda
✗ Jumping into slides without context
```

### Asking Powerful Questions

| Question Type | Purpose | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Open-ended** | Explore deeply | "How would you describe the impact so far?" |
| **Probing** | Dig deeper | "Tell me more about that..." |
| **Clarifying** | Ensure understanding | "When you say X, do you mean...?" |
| **Scaling** | Quantify sentiment | "On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you?" |
| **Hypothetical** | Explore possibilities | "If you could change one thing, what would it be?" |
| **Reflective** | Confirm understanding | "It sounds like... is that right?" |

### Handling Difficult Conversations

```
## When Customer Raises a Problem

1. ACKNOWLEDGE
   "I hear you, and that's a valid concern..."
   Don't minimize or dismiss

2. UNDERSTAND
   "Help me understand more about the impact..."
   Get full picture before responding

3. OWN (if appropriate)
   "We could have done better on that..."
   Take accountability where warranted

4. SOLVE
   "Here's what I propose we do..."
   Move to action quickly

5. CONFIRM
   "Does that address your concern?"
   Ensure resolution

## Example
Customer: "The last release broke our workflow and cost us two days."

CSM: "I'm really sorry that happened — that's not the experience
we want you to have. Can you tell me more about what broke and
the impact on your team?

[Listen fully]

Thank you for sharing that. You're right to be frustrated.
Here's what I want to do: I'll escalate this to our product
team today and get you a detailed response by Friday. I also
want to understand if there's anything we can do to prevent
this in the future. Would a pre-release preview help?

Does that work for you?"
```

### Managing Different Personalities

| Personality | Challenge | Facilitation Approach |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **The Quiet One** | Doesn't share concerns | Direct questions: "Sarah, what's your perspective?" |
| **The Dominator** | Takes over conversation | Redirect: "Great point. Let me hear from others too." |
| **The Skeptic** | Questions everything | Engage directly: "What would convince you?" |
| **The Distracted** | Multitasking, checked out | Involve: "Mark, given your role, what do you think?" |
| **The Detail Seeker** | Wants to go deep on everything | Manage: "Great question — let's take that offline." |
| **The Exec Flyby** | Only here for 15 minutes | Prioritize: "Let's cover the most critical items first." |

### Time Management Techniques

```
## Keeping QBR On Track

BEFORE
- Set clear agenda with time allocations
- Share agenda in advance
- Plan for 10% buffer time

DURING
- Announce time checks: "We have 10 minutes on this..."
- Watch for tangents: "That's important — let's note it
  and circle back if we have time..."
- Use parking lot: "Let's capture that for follow-up..."

IF RUNNING OVER
- Acknowledge: "We're running a bit behind..."
- Prioritize: "The most important thing to cover is..."
- Offer follow-up: "Can we schedule 20 minutes to finish
  this discussion?"

IF RUNNING SHORT
- Use time wisely: "We have extra time — anything else
  you'd like to discuss?"
- Don't fill with slides
- End early if appropriate (executives love this)
```

### Engagement Techniques

| Technique | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Round robin** | Multiple attendees | "Let's hear from each of you..." |
| **Polling** | Gauge alignment | "Show of hands — who agrees?" |
| **Whiteboarding** | Co-creation | "Let me sketch this out..." |
| **Pause** | After key point | [3 second silence] "What questions does that raise?" |
| **Story** | Making a point | "A similar customer faced..." |
| **Data point** | Credibility | "Our research shows..." |

### Closing Techniques

```
## Strong QBR Closings

ACTION SUMMARY
"Let me recap what we've committed to:
- [You/Customer] will [action] by [date]
- [I/CSM] will [action] by [date]
- Our next check-in is [date]
Does that capture everything?"

VALUE REINFORCEMENT
"Thank you for your time today. To summarize the value
we discussed: [key achievement]. Looking ahead, we're
focused on [next goal]. Any final questions?"

APPRECIATION + PREVIEW
"I really appreciate the open dialogue today. You'll
receive a summary within 24 hours. Our next QBR is
tentatively [date] — does that work?"

AVOID
✗ "Well, I guess that's it..."
✗ Trailing off without clear close
✗ Ending without action items
✗ Rushing the close due to time
```

### Virtual QBR Best Practices

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| **Camera** | On for facilitator and key participants |
| **Screen share** | Share only when presenting, stop when discussing |
| **Engagement** | More frequent check-ins than in-person |
| **Chat** | Monitor for questions, use for parking lot |
| **Recording** | Ask permission, share for absent stakeholders |
| **Timing** | 10-15% shorter than in-person equivalent |
| **Breaks** | For QBRs >60 min, offer 5-min break |
| **Follow-up** | Especially important virtually |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Monologue delivery** — Talking at, not with customer
- **Slide dependency** — Reading from slides
- **Question avoidance** — Not asking, just telling
- **Time blindness** — Running over without awareness
- **Weak close** — No commitments, just "any questions?"
- **Single-voice meeting** — Not engaging all attendees
- **Defensive posture** — Arguing instead of understanding
- **Virtual disengagement** — Camera off, no interaction
