# QBR Facilitator

Expert guidance for designing and executing Quarterly Business Reviews that transform routine check-ins into strategic partnership moments. The QBR is your most valuable face time with customer executives — make it count.

## Philosophy

Quarterly Business Reviews are not PowerPoint presentations — they're strategic conversations:

1. **Value over vanity** — Show business impact, not feature usage
2. **Future over past** — Spend 70% on what's next, 30% on what happened
3. **Dialogue over monologue** — QBR is a conversation, not a presentation
4. **Executive time is precious** — Every minute must deliver value
5. **Action over information** — End with commitments, not just insights

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `program-*` — QBR program design, cadence, and governance
- `preparation-*` — Executive stakeholder preparation and research
- `value-*` — ROI demonstration and value storytelling
- `metrics-*` — Success metrics presentation and benchmarking
- `planning-*` — Strategic account planning and success plans
- `roadmap-*` — Product roadmap alignment and feature advocacy
- `risk-*` — Risk identification and opportunity discovery
- `facilitation-*` — Meeting techniques and executive engagement
- `followup-*` — Action tracking and accountability
- `automation-*` — QBR templates, automation, and scalability

### Executive Presence Levels

| Level | Role | QBR Involvement | Key Interests |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------------|
| **C-Suite** | CEO, CFO, CTO | Strategic EBRs only | Business outcomes, ROI, strategy |
| **VP** | VP Operations, VP Sales | Quarterly EBRs | Department impact, efficiency |
| **Director** | Department heads | All QBRs | Team metrics, roadmap, adoption |
| **Manager** | Day-to-day owners | All reviews | Usage, features, support |

### QBR Agenda Structure (60-Minute Template)

| Section | Duration | Focus | Owner |
|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Opening** | 5 min | Alignment, agenda confirmation | CSM |
| **Business Context** | 10 min | Customer updates, priorities | Customer |
| **Value Review** | 15 min | Outcomes, ROI, success metrics | Joint |
| **Strategic Discussion** | 20 min | Roadmap, opportunities, planning | Joint |
| **Action Planning** | 8 min | Commitments, next steps | Joint |
| **Close** | 2 min | Summary, appreciation | CSM |

### Value Demonstration Formula

```
                    (Outcomes Achieved - Baseline)
Value Impact = ──────────────────────────────────── × Business Weight
                         Time Period

Where:
- Outcomes = Measurable results (revenue, time, quality)
- Baseline = Starting point before implementation
- Business Weight = Customer's priority weighting

Example:
"Your team saved 1,200 hours in Q3, valued at $90,000,
representing a 340% ROI on your investment."
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Death by PowerPoint** — 50 slides of usage charts
- **Past-focused reviews** — All backward, no forward
- **Monologue mode** — CSM talks 90% of time
- **Vanity metrics only** — Logins instead of outcomes
- **No executive presence** — Only operational contacts
- **Surprise bad news** — First time hearing about issues
- **No follow-through** — Actions from last QBR incomplete
- **One-size-fits-all** — Same deck for $20K and $500K customers
- **Feature request session** — QBR becomes support ticket
- **No customer voice** — They never share their perspective
