## Training & Enablement Delivery

**Impact: HIGH**

Training is not the same as enablement. Training transfers knowledge; enablement ensures people can actually do the work. Effective training programs increase feature adoption by 40-60% and reduce support tickets by 30%.

### Training vs. Enablement

| Aspect | Training | Enablement |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Focus** | Knowledge transfer | Capability building |
| **Goal** | "Know how" | "Can do" |
| **Method** | Presentation, demonstration | Practice, application |
| **Outcome** | Awareness | Competency |
| **Measure** | Attendance, quiz scores | Task completion, adoption |

### Training Delivery Methods

| **Live instructor-led** | Complex topics, Q&A | Interactive, immediate | Scheduling, cost |
| **Virtual instructor-led** | Remote teams | Convenient, recorded | Less engagement |

| **Video tutorials** | Visual learners | Replayable, scalable | Passive |
| **Hands-on labs** | Skill building | Active learning | Requires setup |
| **Office hours** | Ad hoc support | Flexible, Q&A | Unpredictable |

### Good Training Practices

```
✓ Outcome-focused curriculum
  → "After this, you'll be able to..."
  → Job-relevant scenarios
  → Clear competency targets

✓ Blended learning approach
  → Multiple modalities
  → Live + self-paced combination
  → Reinforcement over time

✓ Hands-on practice
  → Training environment access
  → Real-world exercises
  → Safe space to experiment

✓ Role-based paths
  → Admin vs. user vs. executive
  → Relevant content for each
  → Appropriate depth

✓ Just-in-time support
  → Resources when needed
  → In-app help
  → Quick reference guides
```

### Bad Training Practices

```
✗ Feature tour as training
  → "Here's button X, here's button Y"
  → No workflow context
  → Forgotten immediately

✗ One-size-fits-all sessions
  → Executives bored, users lost
  → Wastes everyone's time

✗ Information dump
  → 4-hour lecture
  → No practice time
  → Cognitive overload

✗ Training once
  → No reinforcement
  → Knowledge decays
  → New hires left out

✗ No practice environment
  → "Don't click that in production"
  → Fear prevents learning

- **PowerPoint marathon** — Slides without practice
- **Premature training** — Before system is configured
- **No reinforcement** — One-time event, no follow-up
- **Skipping administrators** — Expect them to figure it out
- **Ignoring learning styles** — One modality for everyone
- **No success criteria** — Training ends, adoption unknown
- **Generic content** — Not customized for customer use case
