## Onboarding Program Design

**Impact: CRITICAL**

A well-designed onboarding program is the foundation of customer success. The first 90 days determine whether a customer becomes a long-term advocate or an early churn statistic. 70% of customers who churn do so within the first 90 days.

### Onboarding Program Architecture

│                   ONBOARDING PROGRAM LAYERS                      │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  STRATEGIC    Goals → Success Criteria → Value Milestones       │

### Program Design by Segment

| Segment | Duration | Meetings | Content | Personalization |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Enterprise** | 90-180 days | Weekly | Custom playbook | Fully bespoke |
| **Mid-Market** | 60-90 days | Bi-weekly | Templated + custom | Moderate |
| **SMB** | 30-60 days | Monthly | Standardized | Light touch |
| **Self-Serve** | 14-30 days | On-demand | Automated | Behavioral |

### The IMPACT Kickoff Framework

| Step | Purpose | Deliverable | Time |
|------|---------|-------------|------|
| **I**ntroductions | Establish relationships | Stakeholder map | 10 min |
| **M**utual Objectives | Align on outcomes | Documented goals | 20 min |
| **P**lan | Agree on approach | Project timeline | 15 min |
| **A**ccountability | Define ownership | RACI matrix | 10 min |
| **C**ommunication | Set rhythm | Meeting cadence | 10 min |
| **T**imeline | Confirm dates | Key milestones | 10 min |

### Good Program Design

```
✓ Segmented programs
  → Different tracks for different customer types
  → Enterprise gets dedicated resources
  → SMB gets efficient, automated support

✓ Defined success criteria upfront
  → "What does success look like in 90 days?"
  → Measurable, specific outcomes
  → Customer-defined, not vendor-defined

✓ Milestone-based progression
  → Clear checkpoints and gates
  → Celebration at each milestone
  → Adjustment points built in

✓ Flexible frameworks
  → Core structure with customization points
  → Adapts to customer pace and needs
  → Not rigid waterfall

✓ Quick wins built in
  → Value demonstration early
  → Momentum building
  → Stakeholder confidence
```

### Bad Program Design

```
✗ One-size-fits-all approach
  → Enterprise customer on SMB timeline
  → Mismatched resources and expectations

✗ Feature-focused, not outcome-focused
  → "We'll train you on all features"
  → vs "We'll help you achieve X outcome"

✗ No defined end state
  → "Onboarding is complete when..."
  → Undefined success = endless onboarding

✗ Vendor-centric timeline
  → "Our standard is 30 days"
  → Ignores customer reality and constraints

✗ All setup, no value
  → 4 weeks of configuration
  → Customer sees no benefit until end

✗ Inflexible scope
  → "That's Phase 2" when customer needs it now
  → Customer frustration builds
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Kickoff without preparation** — Shows up without knowing the customer
- **Goal setting without customer input** — Vendor defines success alone
- **Rigid program templates** — No flex for customer needs
- **Milestone inflation** — Too many, too detailed, overwhelming
- **No executive involvement** — Lack of strategic alignment
- **Feature tour as kickoff** — Product demo instead of outcome alignment
- **Unclear roles** — "Who's doing what?" questions throughout
- **No baseline metrics** — Can't prove value without starting point
