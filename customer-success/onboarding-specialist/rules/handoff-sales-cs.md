## Sales-to-CS Handoff Excellence

**Impact: HIGH**

The handoff from Sales to Customer Success is one of the most critical moments in the customer lifecycle. A poor handoff creates confusion, repetition, and erodes trust. 35% of customers report having to re-explain their needs after purchase — a preventable failure.

### The Handoff Continuum

```
SALES OWNS                      JOINT                    CS OWNS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Discovery → Evaluation → Close → Handoff → Kickoff → Onboarding
                                   ↑
                         Critical Transition
                         Point of Maximum
                         Risk for Customer
```

### Handoff Timing Models

| Model | Trigger | Pros | Cons |
|-------|---------|------|------|
| **At Close** | Contract signed | Clean transition | No context transfer time |
| **At Kickoff** | First onboarding call | CS meets during sale | Resource overhead |
| **During Sales** | Demo/evaluation | Early relationship | Premature investment |
| **Phased** | Gradual over 2-4 weeks | Smooth transition | Extended ownership |

### Good Handoff Practices

```
✓ Documented handoff
  → Written document, not just verbal
  → Accessible to full CS team
  → Updated as information changes

✓ Warm introduction
  → Sales introduces CS personally
  → "You're in great hands with [CSM]"
  → Shows continuity of care

✓ Internal sync before customer call
  → CS reads handoff doc first
  → Clarifying questions asked
  → Prepared, not cold

✓ Sales available post-handoff
  → For questions from CS
  → For customer escalations
  → Gradual fade, not cliff

✓ Customer validation
  → "Did I capture this correctly?"
  → Surface misalignments early
  → Customer feels heard
```

### Bad Handoff Practices

```
✗ Over-the-wall handoff
  → "Here's the customer, good luck"
  → No context, no introduction
  → Customer feels abandoned

✗ No documentation
  → "Just ask the customer"
  → Customer repeats everything
  → Trust erodes immediately

✗ Overpromise exposure
  → Sales committed to impossible
  → CS discovers during onboarding
  → Customer frustrated, CS blamed

✗ Champion blindness
  → Don't know who the buyer is
  → Engage wrong stakeholders
  → Lack of alignment

✗ Delayed handoff
  → Weeks pass after signing
  → Customer momentum lost
  → "Did they forget about us?"
```

### Handoff Timing Framework

| Trigger | Sales Action | CS Action | Timeline |
|---------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **Deal likely to close** | Alert CS | Assign CSM | 1-2 weeks before |
| **Contract signed** | Complete handoff doc | Review document | Within 24 hours |
| **Handoff doc ready** | Schedule internal meeting | Prepare questions | Within 48 hours |
| **Internal meeting done** | Schedule customer intro | Prepare intro | Within 24 hours |
| **Customer intro done** | Fade to background | Lead relationship | Ongoing |

### Handoff Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Handoff doc completion** | 100% | Docs complete / Deals closed |
| **Handoff meeting completion** | 100% | Meetings held / Deals closed |
| **Time to first CS contact** | <48 hours | Hours from close to contact |
| **Customer repeat rate** | 0% | Times customer re-explains needs |
| **Handoff satisfaction** | >4.5/5 | Customer survey |
| **Smooth transition %** | >90% | No escalations during handoff |

### Sales-CS Alignment

| Topic | Sales Responsibility | CS Responsibility |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Expectations** | Set realistic timelines | Validate and adjust |
| **Promises** | Document all commitments | Honor or escalate |
| **Relationships** | Build, then transfer | Maintain and grow |
| **Success criteria** | Capture during sales | Refine and measure |
| **Risks** | Identify and document | Mitigate and monitor |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Documentation optional** — "I'll just tell you verbally"
- **CS as afterthought** — No CSM assigned until after close
- **Cold customer contact** — CSM reaches out without intro
- **Assumed context** — "They know why they bought"
- **Champion assumption** — "Talk to whoever signed"
- **Promise amnesia** — Commitments not transferred
- **AE disappearance** — Gone immediately after close
- **Template neglect** — Same handoff doc for all customers
