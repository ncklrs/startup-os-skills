## Stakeholder Management

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Successful onboarding requires more than technical execution — it requires people. Managing stakeholders across the customer organization is often the difference between successful adoption and failed implementation. 70% of digital transformation failures cite people issues, not technology.

  → Different perspectives

✓ Executive engagement
  → Regular (monthly) updates
  → Strategic alignment
  → Air cover for project

✓ Champion nurturing
  → Make them look good
  → Provide ammunition
  → Celebrate their wins

✓ Resistance management
  → Understand concerns early
  → Address, don't ignore
  → Convert skeptics to advocates

✓ Change management
  → Communication plan
  → Training for all affected
  → Support through transition
```

### Bad Stakeholder Practices

```
✗ Single-threaded relationship
  → Only know champion
  → No executive connection
  → No backup relationships

✗ Champion neglect
  → Take them for granted
  → Don't celebrate wins
  → Burden without support

✗ Ignoring resistance
  → "They'll come around"
  → Resistance grows underground
  → Sabotage at go-live

✗ Surprising executives
  → Bad news arrives unfiltered
  → No air cover for issues
  → Sponsor pulls support

✗ Assuming alignment
  → "Everyone knows the goal"
  → Hidden agendas emerge
  → Political surprises

### Champion Loss Response

```
## Champion Loss Protocol

### Immediate Actions (Day 1)
□ Acknowledge departure with champion
□ Understand transition timeline
□ Request introduction to successor/backup
□ Document current project state

### Short-term Actions (Week 1)
□ Meet with successor (if identified)
□ Engage backup stakeholders
□ Brief executive sponsor
□ Assess project risk

### Continuity Actions (Week 2-4)
□ Rebuild relationship with new contact
□ Re-confirm success criteria
□ Validate project timeline
□ Adjust engagement approach

### Escalation Criteria
Escalate to leadership if:
□ No successor identified after 1 week
□ New contact disengaged or hostile
□ Project at risk of pause/cancellation
□ Executive sponsor also departing
```

- **Resistance ignorance** — Hope skeptics disappear
- **Political naivety** — Ignoring organizational dynamics
- **Communication absence** — Not keeping people informed
