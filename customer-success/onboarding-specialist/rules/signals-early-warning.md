## Early Warning Signal Detection

**Impact: HIGH**

The best time to save a struggling onboarding is before it becomes a crisis. Most onboarding failures show warning signs 2-4 weeks before they become critical. Systematic detection and intervention can save 60-70% of at-risk implementations.

### The Risk Detection Timeline

```
HEALTHY → EARLY SIGNALS → AT-RISK → CRITICAL → FAILED
   ↓           ↓             ↓          ↓          ↓
 Monitor    Intervene    Escalate   Rescue    Post-mortem
 Weekly     Proactive    Leadership  All-hands  Learn

### Good Detection Practices

```
✓ Systematic monitoring
  → Weekly signal review
  → Defined thresholds
  → Automated alerts where possible

✓ Multiple data sources
  → Product analytics
  → Communication patterns
  → Project tracking
  → Relationship intelligence

✓ Pattern recognition
  → One miss = note
  → Two misses = concern
  → Three misses = action

✓ Proactive inquiry
  → "How are things going?"
  → Don't wait for problems
  → Create safe space for honesty

✓ Fast response
  → Same-day acknowledgment
  → 48-hour action plan
  → Follow through visible
```

### Bad Detection Practices

```
✗ Reactive-only approach
  → Wait for customer complaint
  → Miss early signals
  → Crisis management mode

✗ Single signal reliance
  → "They attend meetings, they're fine"
  → Miss sentiment, adoption issues
  → Surprise churn

✗ Hope-based assessment
  → "I'm sure it will work out"
  → Ignoring warning signs
  → Delays intervention

✗ Delayed response
  → "I'll check on that next week"
  → Issues compound
  → Customer loses confidence

✗ No escalation
