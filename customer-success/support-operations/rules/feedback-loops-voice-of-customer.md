## Support-to-CS Feedback Loops

**Impact: HIGH**

Support is on the front lines of customer experience. Every ticket is a data point. When feedback flows to CS, Product, and Engineering, the entire organization improves. When it doesn't, support becomes a cost center instead of a strategic asset.

### Feedback Types

| Type | Definition | Destination | Action |
|------|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Bug Report** | Product not working as expected | Engineering | Fix and close |
| **Feature Request** | New capability wanted | Product | Evaluate and roadmap |
| **UX Feedback** | Confusion or friction | Product/Design | Improve usability |
| **Documentation Gap** | Missing or unclear docs | Content/Docs | Update content |
| **At-Risk Signal** | Customer frustration pattern | Customer Success | Intervention |
| **Praise/Delight** | Positive feedback | CS/Marketing | Case study, retention |
| **Competitive Intel** | Mentions of competitors | Product/Sales | Positioning update |

### Good Feedback Loop Practices

```
✓ Structured capture
  → Standard fields for feedback type
  → Linked to customer and ticket
  → Searchable and reportable

✓ Regular synthesis
  → Weekly top themes shared
  → Monthly trend analysis
  → Quarterly deep dives

✓ Closed loop
  → Product responds to feedback
  → Support informed of outcomes
  → Customer notified when fixed

✓ Cross-functional visibility
  → Product sees real customer words
  → Engineering understands impact
  → CS sees patterns before escalation

✓ Metrics on feedback impact
  → Tickets reduced by product fixes
  → NPS improved by changes
  → Feature adoption from requests
```

### Bad Feedback Loop Practices

```
✗ Feedback graveyard
  → Collected but never reviewed
  → No one reads the reports

✗ Lost in translation
  → Support paraphrases poorly
  → Customer voice lost

✗ One-way communication
  → Product never responds
  → "We'll pass it along" forever

✗ No aggregation
  → Individual tickets, no patterns
  → Same issue reported 100 times separately

✗ Credit hoarding
  → "This was my idea"
  → Collaboration suffers
```

| **Time to Acknowledgment** | Days until feedback acknowledged | <5 days |
| **Tickets Reduced** | Tickets avoided by product fixes | Track quarter-over-quarter |
| **Feature Adoption** | Usage of requested features | High adoption = good feedback |

### Technology for Feedback Loops

| Tool Type | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Product feedback** | Collect and prioritize requests | Productboard, Canny, Pendo |
| **Bug tracking** | Engineering integration | Jira, Linear, GitHub |

| **Communication** | Cross-team alerts | Slack, Teams channels |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Feedback theater** — Collected but ignored
- **Lost customer voice** — Paraphrased beyond recognition
- **Siloed insights** — Support knows things no one else does
- **Feature factory** — Building what's loudest, not what's important
- **Blame forwarding** — "Product needs to fix this" without partnership
- **No closed loop** — Customer never hears outcome
- **Anecdote over data** — One customer drives roadmap
- **Handoff and forget** — CS gets alert, support never follows up
