## Executive Reporting & Dashboards

**Impact: HIGH**

Executive reporting transforms customer health data into strategic business insights. The goal isn't just presenting metrics — it's enabling better decisions about customer investments, product direction, and company strategy. The best reports tell a story that drives action.

3. Achieve 115% NRR target
```

### Dashboard Design Principles

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Hierarchy** | Most important metrics first | NRR at top, details below |
| **Context** | Always show comparisons | vs. target, vs. prior period |
| **Trend** | Show direction, not just level | Arrows, sparklines |
| **Actionability** | Link to next steps | "2 accounts need attention" |
| **Segmentation** | Break down aggregates | By segment, tier, CSM |
| **Simplicity** | 5-7 key metrics max | Remove nice-to-haves |
| **Consistency** | Same layout each period | Enables quick comparison |

### Data Storytelling Framework

```
The Situation-Complication-Resolution Framework

SITUATION (What's happening)
"Our customer portfolio grew 22% this year to $24.5M ARR
across 485 customers."

COMPLICATION (Why it matters)
"However, our at-risk ARR has increased to $2.1M (8.6%),
driven primarily by declining engagement in the enterprise
segment where NPS dropped 5 points."

RESOLUTION (What we're doing)
"We're launching a dedicated enterprise success program
with executive business reviews, which has shown 40%
improvement in similar situations. Expected impact:
reduce at-risk enterprise ARR by 50% in Q1."

KEY INSIGHT
Lead with the insight, not the data.

Bad: "Health scores averaged 72 this month."
Good: "Customer health improved for the 3rd consecutive month,
      driven by our new onboarding program which reduced
      time-to-value by 35%."
```

### Reporting Cadence

| Report | Audience | Frequency | Content Focus |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Daily Alerts** | CSM, Manager | Daily | Critical risks, action items |
| **Weekly Ops** | CS Team | Weekly | Pipeline, at-risk, wins |
| **Monthly Review** | VP, C-Suite | Monthly | Metrics, trends, initiatives |
| **QBR** | Exec Team, Board | Quarterly | Strategy, risks, investments |
| **Annual Review** | Board | Annually | YoY performance, strategy |

### Dashboard Metrics by Audience

| Metric | Board | C-Suite | VP | Manager |
|--------|-------|---------|-----|---------|
| NRR/GRR | Y | Y | Y | - |
| Health Distribution | Summary | Y | Y | Y |
| At-Risk ARR | $ amount | Y | Y | Account list |
| Churn Analysis | Trends | Details | Details | Accounts |
| CSM Performance | - | Summary | Details | Individual |
| Risk Alerts | - | Critical | All | Assigned |
| Renewal Pipeline | - | Summary | Y | Y |

### Report Automation

| Component | Automation Level | Tools |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Data Collection** | Fully automated | ETL, data warehouse |
| **Metric Calculation** | Fully automated | SQL, dbt |
| **Dashboard Refresh** | Fully automated | Looker, Tableau, Metabase |

### Good vs Bad Metrics Presentation

| Approach | Bad | Good |
|----------|-----|------|
| **Format** | "NRR was 108%" | "NRR of 108% (↑ 3% vs Q3, on track to 110% target)" |
| **Context** | "12 customers churned" | "12 customers churned ($198K), down 22% from prior month" |
| **Insight** | "Health score is 72" | "Health improved 3 points, driven by new onboarding program" |
| **Action** | "At-risk ARR is $2.1M" | "At-risk ARR of $2.1M — 3 accounts need exec intervention" |
| **Trend** | "NPS is 40" | "NPS reached 40 (+8 points YTD), highest in company history" |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Data dump** — Too many metrics without narrative
- **No benchmarks** — Metrics without targets or comparisons
- **Vanity focus** — Highlighting good metrics, hiding problems
- **Stale reporting** — Manual processes creating delays
- **One-size-fits-all** — Same report for board and manager
- **No action items** — Reporting without recommendations
- **Surprise reveals** — Board learns about risks first in meeting
- **Metric overload** — 50 KPIs when 5 would suffice
