## CS Organization Design & Team Structure

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Your CS org structure determines your ceiling for scale. The wrong structure creates bottlenecks, burnout, and missed revenue. The right structure enables predictable growth.

### CS Org Evolution Stages

```
STAGE 1: Founding (0-20 customers)
├── Founder/CEO owns relationships
├── No dedicated CS
└── "Everyone does CS"

STAGE 2: First Hire (20-100 customers)
├── First CSM (generalist)
├── Handles everything
└── Reactive, learning mode

STAGE 3: Specialization (100-500 customers)
├── CSMs by segment/vertical
├── CS Ops/Enablement
└── Onboarding specialist

STAGE 4: Scale (500+ customers)
├── CS Leadership (VP/Director)
├── Segmented teams (Enterprise/MM/SMB)
├── CS Operations team
├── Dedicated Renewals
└── Customer Marketing
```

### Core CS Roles

| Role | Responsibilities | Reports To |
|------|------------------|------------|
| **Chief Customer Officer** | Strategy, executive alignment, revenue ownership | CEO |
| **VP Customer Success** | Team leadership, metrics, cross-functional | CCO/CEO |
| **Director, CS** | Segment ownership, playbooks, forecasting | VP CS |
| **CS Operations** | Systems, data, processes, enablement | VP CS |
| **Enterprise CSM** | High-touch strategic accounts | Director |
| **CSM (Mid-Market)** | Scaled CS for mid-tier | Director |
| **Digital CSM** | Tech-touch programs, automation | CS Ops |
| **Onboarding Specialist** | Implementation, time-to-value | Director |
| **Renewals Manager** | Renewal forecasting, execution | VP CS |

### Team Structures

#### By Segment (Most Common)
```
VP Customer Success
├── Director, Enterprise CS
│   └── Enterprise CSMs (1:15 ratio)
├── Director, Mid-Market CS
│   └── Mid-Market CSMs (1:50 ratio)
├── Manager, Digital CS
│   └── Digital CSMs (1:300+ ratio)
└── CS Operations
```

#### By Function
```
VP Customer Success
├── Onboarding Team
│   └── Implementation Specialists
├── Adoption Team
│   └── CSMs (all segments)
├── Renewals Team
│   └── Renewal Managers
└── CS Operations
```

#### By Industry/Vertical
```
VP Customer Success
├── Healthcare CS Team
├── Financial Services CS Team
├── Technology CS Team
└── CS Operations
```

### CSM-to-Account Ratios

| Segment | ARR Range | Recommended Ratio | Touch Model |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Strategic** | $500k+ | 1:5-10 | Executive touch |
| **Enterprise** | $100k-500k | 1:15-25 | High touch |
| **Mid-Market** | $25k-100k | 1:40-75 | Low touch |
| **SMB** | $5k-25k | 1:100-200 | Pooled/Tech touch |
| **Self-Serve** | <$5k | 1:500+ | Pure tech touch |

### Good Org Design

```
✓ Segment-appropriate coverage
  → Enterprise gets dedicated CSMs
  → SMB gets efficient tech touch
  → Not the same playbook scaled

✓ Clear ownership and accountability
  → Every account has an owner
  → Every metric has an owner
  → No orphan accounts

✓ Career progression paths
  → CSM → Senior → Lead → Manager
  → Specialization paths (Enterprise, Ops, Enablement)
  → Prevents turnover

✓ Right span of control
  → Managers: 5-8 direct reports
  → Directors: 2-4 managers
  → Allows coaching time

✓ Integrated with GTM
  → Clear sales-to-CS handoff
  → CS input to product
  → Renewal/expansion coordination
```

### Bad Org Design

```
✗ One team for all segments
  → Enterprise CSMs managing 200 SMB accounts
  → Impossible to prioritize
  → Burns out your best people

✗ No CS Operations
  → CSMs doing admin, reporting, tool management
  → Expensive resources on low-value work

✗ CSM does everything
  → Sales, implementation, support, renewals
  → Jack of all trades, master of none
  → Impossible to scale

✗ Flat hierarchy
  → 20 CSMs reporting to one VP
  → No coaching, no development
  → High turnover

✗ Siloed from sales
  → No handoff process
  → Competing for customer attention
  → Duplicate conversations
```

### CSM Hiring Profile

| Trait | Why It Matters | How to Assess |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **Business acumen** | Understands customer's business | Case study exercise |
| **Technical aptitude** | Explains product value | Technical walkthrough |
| **Empathy** | Builds trust, understands needs | Behavioral questions |
| **Proactivity** | Anticipates vs reacts | Past examples |
| **Organization** | Manages portfolio effectively | Time management questions |
| **Communication** | Executive presence | Presentation exercise |
| **Resilience** | Handles churn, difficult customers | Adversity examples |

### CSM Interview Questions

```
Strategic Thinking:
→ "How would you prioritize 50 accounts with limited time?"
→ "Walk me through building a success plan for a new enterprise customer"

Customer Management:
→ "Tell me about a time you saved an at-risk account"
→ "How do you handle a customer asking for something we can't deliver?"

Business Acumen:
→ "How do you tie product usage to customer business outcomes?"
→ "Describe how you'd run an Executive Business Review"

Technical:
→ "Explain [your product] to a non-technical executive"
→ "How do you identify adoption gaps from usage data?"
```

### Onboarding New CSMs

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Product & company | Demo certification |
| 2 | CS processes & tools | System access, playbook review |
| 3 | Shadow experienced CSM | Observe customer calls |
| 4 | Co-pilot calls | Run calls with support |
| 5-6 | Own small accounts | First solo accounts |
| 7-8 | Full book of business | Ramp complete |

### Compensation Structure

| Component | % of Total | Tied To |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Base salary** | 60-70% | Role, experience, market |
| **Variable** | 30-40% | Performance metrics |

| Metric | Weight | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **NRR/GRR** | 40-50% | Primary CS outcome |
| **Renewal rate** | 20-30% | Retention focus |
| **Expansion** | 15-25% | Growth incentive |
| **Health scores** | 5-15% | Leading indicator |

### Scaling Checklist

```
□ Define customer segments clearly
  → ARR thresholds, complexity, strategic value

□ Set target CSM ratios per segment
  → Based on touch model requirements

□ Build CS Ops function
  → Before you have 5+ CSMs

□ Create career ladder
  → IC and management tracks

□ Document playbooks
  → Before hiring next CSM

□ Implement CS platform
  → At ~50 customers or 3+ CSMs

□ Establish cross-functional processes
  → Sales handoff, product feedback, support escalation
```

### Org Structure Mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| CSMs stretched too thin | Low health scores, reactive mode | Hire or segment differently |
| No dedicated renewals | Renewals slip, poor forecasting | Add renewals specialist |
| Flat management | High turnover, no coaching | Add team leads |
| CS doing support | Reactive, no proactive time | Clear escalation paths |
| No ops function | CSMs in spreadsheets, inconsistent data | Hire CS Ops |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Hiring ahead of need** — Build playbooks and processes first
- **Copying competitor structure** — Your segment mix is different
- **Promoting best CSM to manager** — Management requires different skills
- **CSM as catch-all** — Clear role boundaries enable specialization
- **Ignoring tenure** — New CSMs need different ratios than experienced
- **Segment by logo not ARR** — A $5k and $500k account aren't the same
- **No ramp time** — Full book on day one guarantees failure
