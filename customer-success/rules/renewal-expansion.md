## Renewal & Expansion Strategy

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Renewals are the foundation of SaaS economics. Expansion is the growth engine. World-class CS organizations don't just retain customers — they grow them. NRR above 100% means you can grow even without new customer acquisition.

### The Renewal-Expansion Relationship

| **Cross-sell** | Additional products | Add new module | 20-30% of expansion |
| **Seat expansion** | More users | 10 → 50 users | 30-40% of expansion |
| **Usage expansion** | More consumption | API calls, storage | 10-20% of expansion |

```

#### Renewal Playbook

| Timeline | Action | Owner | Outcome |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|

| T-14 | Follow-up if unsigned | CSM | Signature |
| T-7 | Escalation if needed | CS Manager | Deal close |
| T-0 | Renewal processed | Finance | Renewal complete |

### Expansion Signals

| Signal | Expansion Type | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Usage at 80%+ of limit** | Upsell tier | "You're outgrowing your plan" |
| **Team growth** | Seat expansion | "Your team is growing, let's expand" |
| **New use case mentioned** | Cross-sell | "We have a solution for that" |
| **High NPS + health** | Any | Proactive expansion conversation |
| **Champion promotion** | Strategic expansion | "Let's expand your success" |
| **Department interest** | Land and expand | Introduction to new teams |
| **Contract anniversary** | Bundle/multi-year | Consolidation offer |

### Expansion Conversation Framework

```
DISCOVERY
─────────
"What new initiatives are you working on?"
"Where are you seeing the most value today?"
"What challenges is your team facing now?"

CONNECT
───────
"Based on your goal to [X], our [feature/product] can help by..."
"Customers in similar situations have seen [outcome]..."

PROPOSE
───────
"Here's what I'd recommend..."
"The investment would be [X] for [outcome]..."

CONFIRM
───────
"Does this align with your priorities?"
"What would you need to see to move forward?"
```

### Good Renewal Practices

```
✓ No surprises
  → Customer knows renewal is coming
  → Value demonstrated throughout year

✓ Early engagement
  → Start at T-90, not T-30
  → Time to address concerns

✓ Value-led conversation
  → "Here's the ROI you've achieved"
  → Not "Here's your invoice"

✓ Multi-threaded
  → Executive sponsor engaged
  → Not just champion

✓ Expansion integrated
  → Natural part of renewal conversation
  → Not separate sales pitch

✓ Risk-aware forecasting
  → Health score informs probability
  → Not wishful thinking
```

### Bad Renewal Practices

```
✗ Last-minute scramble
  → T-7: "Your renewal is due"
  → Customer surprised, annoyed

✗ Contract focus
  → "Just need you to sign"
  → No value discussion

✗ Single-threaded
  → Champion is only contact
  → Risky if champion changes

✗ Discount-first
  → "What discount do you need?"
  → Trains customers to negotiate

✗ Expansion as separate event
  → "Now let me transfer you to sales"
  → Disjointed experience

✗ Hope-based forecasting
  → "They've always renewed"
  → Ignoring warning signs
```

### Renewal Forecasting

```
FORECAST = Σ (Renewal ARR × Probability)

PROBABILITY BY HEALTH:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Health Score │ Probability │ Rationale                          │
├──────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 80-100       │ 95%         │ Healthy, engaged, getting value    │
│ 60-79        │ 85%         │ Stable, some concerns              │
│ 40-59        │ 60%         │ At-risk, needs intervention        │
│ 20-39        │ 30%         │ Critical, save attempt needed      │
│ 0-19         │ 10%         │ Likely churning                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

EXAMPLE:
Customer A: $100k ARR, Health 85 → $95k expected
Customer B: $50k ARR, Health 45 → $30k expected
Customer C: $75k ARR, Health 25 → $22.5k expected

Total due: $225k
Forecast: $147.5k (65.5%)
```

### Expansion Forecasting

| Stage | Probability | Definition |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Identified** | 10% | Signal detected, not discussed |
| **Qualified** | 25% | Customer interested, use case clear |
| **Proposed** | 50% | Proposal presented, under review |
| **Committed** | 75% | Verbal commitment, pending paperwork |
| **Closed** | 100% | Contract signed |

### CS vs Sales Ownership

| Scenario | Primary Owner | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| **Renewal (no change)** | CS | Relationship-driven |
| **Renewal + minor expansion** | CS | Same motion |
| **Significant upsell** | CS + Sales | Sales expertise needed |
| **New product cross-sell** | Sales + CS | Product expertise |
| **New department** | Sales + CS | New stakeholder relationship |

### Handling Downgrades

```
WHEN CUSTOMER WANTS TO DOWNGRADE:

1. UNDERSTAND
   → "Can you help me understand what's driving this?"
   → Get to root cause

2. OPTIONS
   → Address root cause if possible
   → Offer alternatives (pause, different tier)
   → Calculate ROI at current level

3. ACCEPT GRACEFULLY
   → If downgrade is right answer, accept it
   → Preserve relationship for future
   → "We want you to be in the right plan"

4. DOCUMENT
   → Capture reason for downgrades
   → Feed back to product/CS

NEVER:
✗ Make downgrading difficult
✗ Guilt trip the customer
✗ Ignore the request
```

### At-Risk Renewal Escalation

| Risk Level | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **Elevated** | Health 40-59 at T-90 | CSM proactive intervention |
| **High** | Health <40 at T-90 | Manager involvement |
| **Critical** | Health <40 at T-60 | Executive engagement |
| **Emergency** | Cancel signal at any point | Save team activated |

### Renewal Incentive Structure

| Role | Metric | Weight |
|------|--------|--------|
| **CSM** | Book GRR | 40% of variable |
| **CSM** | Book NRR (includes expansion) | 30% of variable |
| **CSM** | Expansion influenced | 20% of variable |
| **CSM** | Health scores | 10% of variable |

### Multi-Year Deals

**When to offer:**
```
✓ High health score (80+)
✓ Strong relationship
✓ Customer values predictability
✓ Strategic account

OFFER STRUCTURE:
1-year: Standard pricing
2-year: 5-10% discount
3-year: 10-15% discount
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced churn risk
- Cash flow predictability
- Deeper partnership

**Risks:**
- Locked into lower price if product improves
- Customer may be unhappy but stuck

### Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **GRR** | Retained revenue / Starting revenue | 90%+ |
| **NRR** | (Retained + Expansion) / Starting | 110%+ |
| **Renewal rate** | Renewed contracts / Due contracts | 85%+ |
| **Early renewal rate** | Renewed before due / Total renewals | 30%+ |
| **Expansion rate** | Expanded customers / Total customers | 15-25% |
| **Expansion revenue** | Expansion / Starting revenue | 10-20% |
| **Forecast accuracy** | Actual / Forecast | 90%+ |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Reactive renewals** — Starting at T-30 is too late
- **Contract-focused** — "Sign here" without value conversation
- **Discount-led saves** — Trains customers to threaten churn
- **Ignoring at-risk** — Hope is not a strategy
- **Expansion as separate process** — Should be integrated with CS
- **Single-threaded renewals** — Champion leaves, renewal at risk
- **No expansion motion** — Leaving money on the table
- **Poor handoff CS/Sales** — Customer gets pinballed between teams
