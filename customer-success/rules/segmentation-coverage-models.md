## Customer Segmentation & Coverage Models

**Impact: CRITICAL**

The #1 mistake in Customer Success is treating all customers the same. Segmentation is not optional — it's the foundation of scalable CS. Your coverage model determines unit economics, customer experience, and team sanity.

### The Three-Tier Model

### Segmentation Criteria

| Dimension | High Touch | Low Touch | Tech Touch |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| **ARR** | $100k+ | $15k-$100k | <$15k |
| **Complexity** | Multi-dept, integrations | Department-level | Single user/team |
| **Strategic Value** | Lighthouse, growth potential | Standard fit | Transactional |
| **Industry** | Key verticals | Secondary verticals | Long tail |
| **Stakeholders** | 5+ contacts | 2-4 contacts | 1-2 contacts |

### Beyond ARR: Multi-Dimensional Segmentation

```
Simple ARR-only segmentation:
  $100k+ = High Touch
  $15k-100k = Low Touch
  <$15k = Tech Touch

Better multi-factor segmentation:
  Score = (ARR weight × ARR tier)
        + (Complexity weight × complexity score)
        + (Growth weight × expansion potential)
        + (Strategic weight × strategic fit)

Example weights:
  ARR: 40%
  Complexity: 25%
  Growth potential: 20%
  Strategic value: 15%
```

### Segmentation Matrix

| | Low Complexity | High Complexity |
|---|----------------|-----------------|
| **High ARR** | Low Touch (efficient enterprise) | High Touch |
| **Low ARR** | Tech Touch | Low Touch (invest in potential) |

| | Low Growth Potential | High Growth Potential |
|---|---------------------|----------------------|
| **High ARR** | High Touch (protect) | High Touch (expand) |
| **Low ARR** | Tech Touch | Low Touch (invest) |

### Good Segmentation

```
✓ Data-driven thresholds
  → Based on analysis of cost-to-serve and outcomes
  → Not arbitrary round numbers

✓ Multi-dimensional
  → ARR + complexity + potential + fit
  → Not just contract size

✓ Dynamic reassignment
  → Accounts move between segments
  → Expansion triggers high-touch upgrade

✓ Clear criteria
  → Anyone can determine segment from data
  → No subjective judgment

✓ Tied to economics
  → Cost-to-serve sustainable at each tier
  → Profitable at scale

✓ Different playbooks
  → Distinct approaches, not just different ratios
  → Tech touch ≠ low touch with fewer calls
```

### Bad Segmentation

```
✗ ARR-only
  → $99k account treated completely differently than $101k
  → Ignores complexity, potential, strategic value

✗ Static assignment
  → "They signed as SMB, they're always SMB"
  → Even after 5x expansion

✗ Too many segments
  → 10 segments with 10 different playbooks
  → Impossible to execute consistently

✗ Gut feel
  → "This customer feels important"
  → No objective criteria

✗ Same playbook, different frequency
  → Low touch = high touch with fewer meetings
  → Misses the point entirely

✗ Ignoring cost economics
  → High-touch treatment for $5k accounts
  → Unprofitable and unsustainable
```

### Coverage Model Economics

| Segment | Target Cost-to-Serve | CSM Cost Model |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **High Touch** | 15-25% of ARR | Dedicated CSM |
| **Low Touch** | 5-10% of ARR | Pooled CSM |
| **Tech Touch** | <3% of ARR | Automation + reactive |

**Example calculation:**
```
Enterprise account: $200k ARR
CSM fully-loaded cost: $150k/year
CSM ratio: 1:15 accounts
Cost per account: $150k / 15 = $10k
Cost-to-serve: $10k / $200k = 5% ✓

SMB account: $10k ARR
If same CSM ratio (1:15): $10k cost = 100% of ARR ✗
Need 1:150 ratio: $1k cost = 10% of ARR
Or tech touch: <$300 cost = 3% of ARR ✓
```

### High Touch Playbook Elements

| Element | Frequency | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Kickoff call** | At close | Alignment, success criteria |
| **Success planning** | First 30 days | Define outcomes, milestones |
| **Weekly check-ins** | Weekly (early) | Adoption support |
| **Bi-weekly syncs** | Bi-weekly (steady state) | Relationship, health |
| **QBRs** | Quarterly | Value, roadmap, expansion |
| **EBRs** | Semi-annual | Executive alignment |
| **Renewal planning** | 90 days out | Secure commitment |

### Low Touch Playbook Elements

| Element | Frequency | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Automated welcome** | Day 0 | Set expectations |
| **Onboarding webinar** | Week 1 | Group enablement |
| **30-day check-in** | Day 30 | Health check, intervention |
| **Monthly office hours** | Monthly | Pooled access to CSM |
| **Quarterly email** | Quarterly | Value summary, tips |
| **Group QBRs** | Quarterly | Scaled business reviews |
| **Renewal email sequence** | 60 days out | Automated renewal |
| **Triggered outreach** | As needed | Health-based intervention |

### Tech Touch Playbook Elements

| Element | Trigger | Channel |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Welcome sequence** | Sign-up | Email (5-7 emails) |
| **Onboarding checklist** | First login | In-app |
| **Feature adoption prompts** | Usage patterns | In-app |
| **Monthly product digest** | Monthly | Email |
| **Usage milestone celebrations** | Achievement | Email + in-app |
| **NPS survey** | Day 30, 90, 365 | Email |
| **Re-engagement campaign** | 14 days inactive | Email |
| **Renewal reminder** | 30 days out | Email + in-app |
| **Self-service resources** | Always available | Knowledge base |
| **Community access** | Sign-up | Community platform |

### Segment Transition Triggers

| Transition | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Tech → Low Touch | Expansion to $15k+ | Assign pooled CSM |
| Low → High Touch | Expansion to $100k+ | Dedicated CSM assignment |
| High → Low Touch | Contraction below $100k | Transition to pooled model |
| Low → Tech Touch | Contraction below $15k | Move to automation |
| Any → High Touch | Strategic designation | Override, assign dedicated |
| At-risk (any tier) | Health score <40 | Temporary upgrade |

### Pooled Model Operations

```
The Low Touch "Pooled" Model:

Option A: Geographic pools
  → West Coast CSM, East Coast CSM, etc.
  → Timezone alignment

Option B: Industry pools
  → Healthcare CSM, Finance CSM, etc.
  → Domain expertise

Option C: Round-robin
  → Next available CSM
  → Load balancing

Pooled model rules:
  → Customer always knows their "team" even if no dedicated CSM
  → CRM shows account owner for routing
  → Shared context in CS platform
  → Warm handoffs between pool members
```

### Hybrid Model: Digital + Human

```
Best-in-class low touch combines:

DIGITAL LAYER (always on):
  → Automated health monitoring
  → Triggered email campaigns
  → In-app guidance
  → Self-service resources

HUMAN LAYER (triggered):
  → Health score drops → CSM outreach
  → Expansion signals → CSM call
  → Support escalation → CSM follow-up
  → Renewal approaching → CSM check-in
```

### Measuring Segment Performance

| Metric | By Segment | Why |
|--------|------------|-----|
| **GRR** | Compare across tiers | Validate coverage model |
| **NRR** | Compare across tiers | Expansion effectiveness |
| **Time to Value** | Compare across tiers | Onboarding efficiency |
| **NPS** | Compare across tiers | Experience quality |
| **Cost-to-serve** | Track per segment | Unit economics |
| **CSM utilization** | Track per segment | Capacity planning |

### Segment-Specific Health Scores

| Component | High Touch Weight | Low Touch Weight | Tech Touch Weight |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Product usage** | 30% | 35% | 50% |
| **Relationship** | 25% | 15% | 5% |
| **Support** | 15% | 20% | 25% |
| **Growth signals** | 15% | 15% | 10% |
| **Financial** | 15% | 15% | 10% |

### Anti-Patterns

- **One playbook for all** — Tech touch cannot be high touch without calls
- **Segment by logo count** — 10 small accounts ≠ 1 enterprise account
- **Over-investing in SMB** — Unprofitable, unsustainable, unfair to enterprise
- **Under-investing in tech touch** — 80% of customers, deserves real strategy
- **Static forever** — Segments should shift as customers grow/shrink
- **Arbitrary thresholds** — $99k vs $101k shouldn't be a cliff
- **Ignoring complexity** — Simple $150k account may need less than complex $80k
- **Treating expansion same as new** — Existing high-touch customer expanding SMB product line
