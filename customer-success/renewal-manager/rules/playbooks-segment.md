## Renewal Playbooks by Segment

**Impact: CRITICAL**

One-size-fits-all renewal motions fail. Enterprise customers need white-glove treatment; SMB customers need efficient, automated journeys. Segment-specific playbooks ensure the right experience and resource allocation for maximum retention.

### Segment Definitions

| Segment | ARR Range | Touch Model | CSM Ratio | Renewal Lead |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Enterprise** | $100K+ | High-touch | 1:10-20 | Named CSM |
| **Mid-Market** | $25K-$100K | Medium-touch | 1:30-50 | Pooled CSM |
| **SMB** | $5K-$25K | Low-touch | 1:100-200 | Digital + CSM |
| **Self-Serve** | <$5K | Tech-touch | Automated | System |

### Good Playbook Practices

```
✓ Segment-appropriate effort
  → Enterprise: 6-month white-glove
  → SMB: Efficient, automated
  → Match effort to value

✓ Multi-channel engagement
  → Email, calls, in-app, video
  → Customer channel preference
  → Redundancy for critical messages

✓ Risk-based routing
  → Green → Standard automation
  → Yellow → CSM intervention
  → Red → Intensive save play

✓ Clear escalation paths
  → CSM can't close → Manager
  → Manager can't close → Executive
  → Timely escalation, not last-minute

✓ Expansion integrated
  → Renewal + growth in same motion
  → Not separate conversations
  → Natural upsell positioning
```

### Bad Playbook Practices

```
✗ Same motion for all segments
  → Enterprise on SMB timeline
  → SMB getting enterprise effort
  → Misallocated resources

✗ Email-only communication
  → Easy to ignore
  → No personal connection
  → Lower conversion

✗ Reactive engagement
  → First contact at day 30
  → No time for issues
  → Panic mode

✗ No escalation process
  → CSM struggles alone
  → Deals slip unnecessarily
  → Lost revenue

✗ Separate expansion conversation
  → "We'll talk about that later"
  → Misses the renewal window
  → Growth opportunity lost
```

### Playbook Selection Matrix

| Health Score | Segment | Playbook | Key Action |
|--------------|---------|----------|------------|
| Green | Enterprise | Standard high-touch | Expansion focus |
| Green | Mid-Market | Standard medium-touch | Multi-year offer |
| Green | SMB | Automated | Self-service |
| Yellow | Enterprise | Intensive high-touch | Exec engagement |
| Yellow | Mid-Market | CSM-led | Value reinforcement |
| Yellow | SMB | CSM intervention | Personal outreach |
| Red | Enterprise | Executive save | CEO-to-CEO |
| Red | Mid-Market | Manager escalation | Save offer |
| Red | SMB | Final offer | Retention discount |

- **Starting too late** — Enterprise renewal starting at day 60
- **Playbook rigidity** — No flex for customer circumstances
- **Single-channel** — All email, no calls or meetings
- **No risk segmentation** — Same motion for healthy and at-risk
- **Manual everything** — CSM doing tasks that should be automated
- **Playbook abandonment** — Starting strong, fading out
- **No measurement** — Not tracking playbook effectiveness
