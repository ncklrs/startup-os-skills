## Multi-Year Deal Structuring

**Impact: HIGH**

Multi-year deals are the gold standard for predictable revenue. A 3-year contract reduces annual churn risk by 67% and significantly improves customer LTV. The key is structuring deals that genuinely benefit both parties — not just extracting commitment through discounts.

### Multi-Year Discount Framework

| Term Length | Suggested Discount | Payment Terms | Commitment Level |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **1 Year** | 0% (baseline) | Annual or monthly | Standard |
| **2 Years** | 5-10% | Annual | Medium |
| **3 Years** | 10-15% | Annual | High |
| **4+ Years** | 15-20% | Annual | Very High |

### Payment Structure Options

| Structure | Description | Best For | Considerations |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Prepaid Full** | Pay entire term upfront | Cash-flush customers | Maximum discount, cash flow benefit |
| **Annual Prepaid** | Pay each year in advance | Standard enterprise | Balance of flexibility and commitment |
| **Quarterly** | Pay quarterly in advance | Cash-conscious | Smaller discount, more admin |
| **Monthly** | Monthly payments | Start-ups, SMB | Higher price, maximum flexibility |

### Good Multi-Year Practices

```
✓ Value-based positioning
  → "Strategic partnership" not "longer contract"
  → Focus on what customer gains
  → Position as mutual investment

✓ Meaningful discount
  → Worth the commitment
  → Not so deep it devalues product
  → Earn through term, not desperation

✓ Price protection inclusion
  → Lock in today's rates
  → Immunity from increases
  → Explicit in contract

✓ Flexibility provisions
  → Growth accommodation
  → Minor adjustment allowances
  → Not a prison sentence

✓ Termination clarity
  → Clear terms if things change
  → Fair exit provisions
  → Builds trust
```

### Bad Multi-Year Practices

```
✗ Discount as primary pitch
  → "Sign 3 years, get 20% off"
  → Commoditizes the product
  → Trains discount expectation

✗ Rigid contracts
  → No accommodation for change
  → Punitive exit terms
  → Customer feels trapped

✗ Overselling term length
  → Pushing 5-year on uncertain fit
  → Customer regrets, damages relationship
  → Becomes reluctant to engage

✗ Hidden escalations
  → Price increases in year 2-3
  → Customer surprised, angry
  → Trust destroyed

✗ Same terms for everyone
  → Enterprise on SMB terms
  → Missing segment optimization
  → Leaving value on table
