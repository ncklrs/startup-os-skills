## Renewal Forecasting & Pipeline Management

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Accurate renewal forecasting is the foundation of predictable revenue. Companies with mature renewal forecasting achieve 95%+ accuracy, while immature organizations frequently miss by 20%+ — destroying financial predictability and stakeholder confidence.

### Renewal Probability Scoring

| Stage | Probability | Criteria |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Future** | 70-80% | Based on historical cohort performance |
| **Upcoming - Healthy** | 85-95% | Green health score, engaged |
| **Upcoming - At Risk** | 50-70% | Yellow/orange health |
| **Active - Engaged** | 90-95% | Quote delivered, positive signals |
| **Active - Stalled** | 60-75% | No response, delayed |
| **Closing - Committed** | 98%+ | Verbal/written commitment |
| **Closing - At Risk** | 70-85% | Last-minute issues |

### Good Forecasting Practices

```
✓ Cohort-based forecasting
  → Group renewals by segment, tenure, health
  → Apply historical conversion rates by cohort
  → More accurate than deal-by-deal guessing

✓ Rolling forecast updates
  → Weekly pipeline reviews
  → Monthly forecast adjustments
  → Quarterly trend analysis

✓ Multi-dimensional probability
  → Health score + engagement + usage
  → Not just "CSM gut feel"
  → Data-driven probability assignment

✓ Conservative early, confident late
  → 180 days: Use cohort averages
  → 90 days: Refine with deal signals
  → 30 days: High confidence required

✓ Pipeline hygiene discipline
  → Weekly stage validation
  → Remove stale deals
  → Update close dates realistically
```

### Bad Forecasting Practices

```
✗ Optimism bias
  → "I think they'll renew"
  → No objective criteria
  → Consistently overforecasting

✗ Stale pipeline data
  → Renewals stuck in wrong stages
  → Close dates never updated
  → False confidence in numbers

✗ Single-point forecasting
  → One number per deal
  → No range or scenario planning
  → Surprise misses

✗ Ignoring leading indicators
  → Usage dropping, still 90% forecast
  → Champion left, no adjustment
  → Reality catches up late

✗ Last-minute changes
  → Major adjustments in final week
  → Leadership loses confidence
  → Credibility erosion
```

### Forecast Categories

| Category | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Commit** | Will close this period, high confidence | Included in guidance |
| **Best Case** | Likely to close, some risk remains | Upside scenario |
| **Pipeline** | Active but uncertain timing | Monitor closely |
| **At Risk** | Signals suggest may not renew | Save play required |
| **Lost** | Confirmed non-renewal | Remove from forecast |

### Cohort Analysis Framework

| Cohort Dimension | Segments | Insight |
|------------------|----------|---------|
| **Customer Size** | Enterprise, MM, SMB | Retention rate by segment |
| **Industry** | Tech, Finance, Healthcare, etc. | Industry-specific patterns |
| **Tenure** | Year 1, Year 2, Year 3+ | Renewal rate by maturity |
| **Product** | Core, Add-ons, Platform | Product-level retention |
| **Health Score** | Green, Yellow, Red | Predictive accuracy |
| **Expansion History** | Expanded, Flat, Contracted | Growth correlation |

### Cohort Performance Tracking

### Scenario Planning

| Scenario | Assumptions | Revenue Impact |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Best Case** | All greens renew + 50% expansion | +15% NRR |
| **Expected** | Historical cohort rates | +5% NRR |
| **Conservative** | 5% lower conversion, no expansion | -3% NRR |
| **Worst Case** | Major churn event | -10% NRR |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Set and forget** — Forecast once, never update
- **Gut-feel probability** — "I think 80%" with no criteria
- **Happy ears** — Customer said "probably" = 95% commit
- **Pipeline stuffing** — Inflated numbers for optics
- **Blame game** — Forecast miss = someone else's fault
- **Data lag** — Using week-old information for decisions
- **Single number obsession** — No range or scenario thinking
- **Ignoring patterns** — Same cohort misses repeatedly
