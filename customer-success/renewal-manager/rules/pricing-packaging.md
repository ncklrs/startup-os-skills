## Pricing & Packaging for Renewals

**Impact: HIGH**

Renewal pricing is where value meets commercial reality. The right pricing strategy protects revenue, enables expansion, and reinforces value — while avoiding the discount death spiral that erodes margins and trains customers to negotiate harder each year.

### Renewal Pricing Principles

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                RENEWAL PRICING PHILOSOPHY                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                  │
│  1. VALUE FIRST, PRICE SECOND                                   │
│     → Demonstrate ROI before discussing price                   │
│     → Price is justified by outcomes achieved                   │
│                                                                  │
│  2. DISCOUNTS ARE EARNED, NOT GIVEN                             │
│     → Commitment earns discount                                 │
│     → Value exchange, not concession                            │
│                                                                  │
│  3. PRICE INTEGRITY MATTERS                                     │
│     → Consistent policies build trust                           │
│     → Random discounts create resentment                        │
│                                                                  │
│  4. EXPANSION IS THE GOAL                                       │
│     → Renewal at flat = missed opportunity                      │
│     → Growth should be the natural path                         │
│                                                                  │
│  5. SIMPLICITY WINS                                             │
│     → Clear pricing, easy to understand                         │
│     → No hidden fees or gotchas                                 │

### Renewal Pricing Scenarios

| Scenario | Approach | Justification |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **High value, high usage** | Flat or uplift | Worth the investment |
| **High value, low usage** | Address adoption first | Usage problem, not price |
| **Low value, high usage** | Reinforce value | Demonstrate outcomes |
| **Low value, low usage** | Save play or exit | Risk of churn |
| **Significant expansion** | Growth discount | Reward investment |
| **Multi-year commitment** | Term discount | Lock-in value |
| **Strategic account** | Partnership pricing | Long-term relationship |

### Discount Policy Framework

| Discount Type | Max Amount | Criteria | Approval |
|---------------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Multi-Year** | 5-15% | 2-3+ year commitment | Standard |
| **Prepayment** | 5-10% | Annual upfront | Standard |
| **Volume** | 5-20% | User/seat thresholds | Tiered |

### Good Pricing Practices

```
✓ Value-based pricing discussions
  → "Based on your ROI of $X, this renewal is..."
  → Lead with outcomes, not costs
  → Make price feel reasonable vs. value

✓ Clear discount policies
  → Published, consistent criteria
  → Customers know what to expect
  → No "squeaky wheel" dynamics

✓ Expansion incentives
  → Better rates at higher volumes
  → Growth rewarded, not penalized
  → Natural path to expansion

✓ Price increase communication
  → Advance notice (90+ days)
  → Justification provided
  → Value additions highlighted

✓ Packaging flexibility
  → Options at different price points
  → Right-sizing possible
  → No forced overbuying
```

### Bad Pricing Practices

```
✗ Discount negotiation every renewal
  → Customer expects haggling
  → Erodes pricing integrity
  → Time-consuming, margin-destroying

✗ Arbitrary discounts
  → "I'll see what I can do"
  → No policy, just negotiation
  → Some customers overpay, others underpay

✗ Surprise price increases
  → Customer blindsided at renewal
  → Trust destroyed
  → Competitive opening

✗ Complex pricing structures
  → Too many SKUs
  → Hidden fees
  → Customer confusion → frustration

✗ Penalizing loyalty
  → New customer discount, not for existing
  → Long-term customer pays more
  → Resentment, churn risk
```

### Price Increase Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | Approach |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Annual Escalator** | Built into contract | 3-5% automatic |
| **Value-Based Increase** | New features added | Tied to enhancements |
| **Market Adjustment** | Industry-wide shift | Benchmark justification |
| **Package Upgrade** | Forced to new tier | Improved capabilities |
| **Grandfathering** | Loyal customers | Delayed or reduced increase |

### Packaging Optimization

| Packaging Issue | Solution | Benefit |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| **Over-licensed** | Right-size to actual usage | Better value perception |
| **Under-licensed** | True-up + growth discount | Revenue + compliance |
| **Wrong tier** | Upgrade/downgrade options | Better fit |
| **Siloed products** | Bundle pricing | Stickiness + discount |
| **Feature bloat** | Modular pricing | Pay for what you use |

### Renewal Pricing Conversation Flow

```
## Renewal Pricing Discussion Framework

1. VALUE FOUNDATION (Before Price)
   "Let's review what you've achieved..."
   - Review ROI and outcomes
   - Confirm ongoing value
   - Understand evolving needs

2. NEEDS ASSESSMENT (Packaging)
   "Looking ahead, what's changing for your team?"
   - Growth plans
   - Feature needs
   - User changes

3. PRICING PRESENTATION (After Value)
   "Based on your usage and growth, here's what I recommend..."
   - Right-sized package
   - Clear pricing
   - Discount criteria explained

4. OPTIONS (Not Ultimatums)
   "We have a few options depending on your preferences..."
   - Multi-year option
   - Payment flexibility
   - Package variations

5. COMMITMENT (Value Exchange)
   "For [commitment], we can offer [benefit]..."
   - Discount tied to something
   - Not free concession
   - Mutual value
```

### Competitive Pricing Response

| Competitive Situation | Response | Avoid |
|-----------------------|----------|-------|
| **"Competitor is cheaper"** | Value differentiation + match meeting | Price race to bottom |
| **"They offered X% off"** | Understand full offer, TCO comparison | Blind matching |
| **"We're evaluating options"** | ROI reinforcement, switching costs | Panic discounting |
| **"Budget pressure"** | Right-sizing, payment flexibility | Deep discount |
