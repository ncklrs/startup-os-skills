## Discovery Call Structure and Flow

**Impact: CRITICAL**

A well-structured discovery call feels like a conversation, not an interrogation. The right flow builds rapport, uncovers insight, and earns the next step.

### The Discovery Call Arc

### Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

#### Phase 1: Opening (5 minutes)

**Goals:**
- Build rapport
- Set agenda and expectations
- Confirm available time

**Script framework:**
```
"Hi [Name], thanks for making time today. Before we dive in,
I wanted to confirm - we have 45 minutes, is that still good?

[Confirm time]

Great. Here's what I'd like to accomplish today:
1. Learn about your current situation and what prompted this conversation
2. Understand your key challenges and priorities
3. Determine if there's a fit and discuss potential next steps

Does that work for you? Is there anything specific you'd like to
make sure we cover?"

[Get their input]

"Perfect. To kick things off, I'm curious - what prompted you to
take this meeting today?"
```

**Rapport builders:**
- Reference something from research (genuinely)
- Find common ground (mutual connection, shared experience)
- Show genuine curiosity
- Keep it brief - 1-2 minutes max

#### Phase 2: Situation (10 minutes)

**Goals:**
- Understand current state
- Establish context for pain
- Identify key players and processes

**Key questions:**
```
"Walk me through how your team currently handles [relevant area]."

"What tools and systems are you using today?"

"Who on your team is involved in this process?"

"How long have you been doing it this way?"
```

**Transition to problems:**
```
"That's helpful context. Now I'm curious - what's working well
with your current approach, and what's not working as well?"
```

#### Phase 3: Problem/Pain (15 minutes)

**Goals:**
- Surface specific challenges
- Understand depth and breadth of pain
- Capture emotional indicators

**Key questions:**
```
"What's the most frustrating part of your current approach?"

"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing, what would it be?"

"What happens when [specific scenario] occurs?"

"Where do things fall through the cracks?"
```

**Deepening techniques:**
```
"Tell me more about that."

"What do you mean by [their term]?"

"Can you give me a specific example?"

"How often does that happen?"

"Who else is affected by that?"
```

#### Phase 4: Implication & Need-Payoff (10 minutes)

**Goals:**
- Quantify impact of problems
- Create urgency
- Have them articulate value of solving

**Implication questions:**
```
"When that happens, what's the downstream impact?"

"How much time does your team spend dealing with this?"

"What's at risk if this doesn't get solved?"

"What's the cost to the business?"
```

**Need-payoff questions:**
```
"If you could solve this, what would change for your team?"

"What would it mean for the business to have this fixed?"

"How would that affect [their stated goal]?"
```

#### Phase 5: Closing (5-10 minutes)

**Goals:**
- Summarize understanding
- Confirm fit
- Secure specific next step

**Framework:**
```
"Let me make sure I captured everything correctly.

[Summarize situation]
You're currently [situation], and the main challenges are
[pain 1] and [pain 2].

[Summarize impact]
This is costing roughly [quantified impact] and is driving
urgency because of [critical event].

[Summarize need]
What you're looking for is [need/vision].

Did I get that right? Is there anything I missed?

[Confirm]

Based on what you've shared, I think there's a strong fit.
The logical next step would be [specific next step] with
[relevant people].

I have availability [Day 1] at [Time] or [Day 2] at [Time].
Which works better for you?"
```

### Call Time Allocation by Length

| Call Length | Open | Situation | Problem/Pain | Impact/Vision | Close |
|-------------|------|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **30 min** | 3 min | 5 min | 10 min | 7 min | 5 min |
| **45 min** | 5 min | 10 min | 15 min | 10 min | 5 min |
| **60 min** | 5 min | 12 min | 20 min | 15 min | 8 min |

### Transition Phrases

**Opening → Situation:**
```
"To make sure I ask the right questions, can you give me some
context on your current setup?"
```

**Situation → Problems:**
```
"Thanks for that overview. I'm curious - what's working well
and what's challenging about your current approach?"
```

**Problems → Implications:**
```
"That sounds frustrating. Help me understand the impact - when
that happens, what's the ripple effect?"
```

**Implications → Need-Payoff:**
```
"Given the impact you described, what would it look like if
this was completely solved?"
```

**Need-Payoff → Close:**
```
"Based on everything you've shared, here's what I'm thinking..."
```

### Handling Common Flow Disruptions

| Disruption | How to Handle |
|------------|---------------|
| **They want to see a demo first** | "I'd love to show you, and to make the demo relevant, I'd like to understand your situation first. Can you give me 10 minutes of context?" |
| **They're asking pricing early** | "I can definitely give you a sense of investment. To give you an accurate picture, can I ask a few questions first?" |
| **They're running short on time** | "I want to respect your time. What's most important for us to cover in the remaining time?" |
| **They go off on tangents** | "That's interesting. I'd love to dig into that more. First, can I make sure I understand [return to topic]?" |
| **They give one-word answers** | "Can you tell me more about that? I want to make sure I really understand." |
| **Multiple people talking** | Address each by name, invite quieter attendees: "[Name], I'd love your perspective on this." |

### Pacing Indicators

**Going too slow if:**
- You're 20 minutes in and still on situation
- Prospect seems impatient or checking time
- Answers becoming shorter

**Going too fast if:**
- Surface-level answers only
- Haven't uncovered quantified pain
- Prospect seems confused about direction

**Adjust by:**
- Checking in: "Are we covering the right things?"
- Summarizing: "Let me make sure I've got this right..."
- Redirecting: "I want to make sure we have time for [important area]"

### Anti-Patterns

- **Skipping the open** — Diving straight into questions
- **Spending too long on situation** — 20 minutes of context, no pain
- **Not quantifying** — Pain points without numbers
- **Weak close** — "I'll send you some info" instead of next meeting
- **Rigid adherence** — Following structure over conversation
- **No time check** — Running over or getting cut off
