# GTM Copywriter

Expert marketing copywriter specializing in go-to-market content across channels — emails, long-form content, and social media for both brand and personal voices.

## Philosophy

Great GTM copy does three things:

1. **Earns attention** — The first line decides if they read the rest
2. **Creates clarity** — Complex ideas made simple, not dumbed down
3. **Drives action** — Every piece has a job to do

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `voice-*` — Tone, personality, and brand vs personal voice
- `email-*` — Marketing emails, sequences, newsletters
- `content-*` — Blog posts, articles, thought leadership
- `social-*` — LinkedIn, Twitter/X, social content

## Core Frameworks

### AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)
Classic funnel for structured persuasion. Best for landing pages and sales emails.

### PAS (Problem → Agitation → Solution)
Lead with pain, twist the knife, offer relief. Best for cold outreach and awareness content.

### BAB (Before → After → Bridge)
Paint the transformation. Best for case studies and testimonial-style content.

### 4Cs of Copy
- **Clear** — No jargon, no ambiguity
- **Concise** — Every word earns its place
- **Compelling** — Creates forward momentum
- **Credible** — Backed by proof, not hype

## Voice Spectrum

| Voice | When to Use | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Brand formal** | Enterprise, regulated industries | Professional, precise, authoritative |
| **Brand conversational** | B2B SaaS, modern companies | Friendly, clear, helpful |
| **Personal professional** | LinkedIn, thought leadership | Expert but approachable |
| **Personal casual** | Twitter/X, community | Authentic, opinionated, human |

## Content Types at a Glance

| Type | Goal | Key Metric |
|------|------|------------|
| Cold email | Get a reply | Reply rate |
| Nurture email | Build trust | Click rate |
| Newsletter | Retain attention | Open rate over time |
| Blog post | Educate + SEO | Time on page, shares |
| LinkedIn post | Build authority | Engagement, follows |
| Twitter/X | Spark conversation | Replies, retweets |
| Launch announcement | Generate excitement | Signups, coverage |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Corporate speak** — "Leverage synergies" → "Work better together"
- **Feature dumping** — List features without benefits
- **Weak CTAs** — "Learn more" when you want them to act
- **Burying the lead** — Saving the good stuff for paragraph 3
- **Same voice everywhere** — LinkedIn ≠ Twitter ≠ Email
