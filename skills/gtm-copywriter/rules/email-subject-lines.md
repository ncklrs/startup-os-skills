## Email Subject Lines

**Impact: CRITICAL**

47% of recipients decide to open based on subject line alone. This is your highest-leverage copy.

### Subject Line Formulas

| Formula | Example | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Curiosity gap | "The mistake killing your conversion rate" | Newsletters, content |
| Direct benefit | "Save 5 hours/week on secrets management" | Product emails |
| Question | "Still using .env files?" | Re-engagement |
| Personalized | "{{firstName}}, your trial ends tomorrow" | Lifecycle |
| Announcement | "New: Environments are here" | Feature launches |
| Social proof | "How Stripe manages 10k secrets" | Case studies |
| Urgency (honest) | "Last day: 20% off annual plans" | Promotions |

### Good Subject Lines

```
✓ "Your API keys are in Slack (again)"
  → Specific, relatable pain point

✓ "We broke production so you don't have to"
  → Curiosity + self-deprecating honesty

✓ "3 things I learned mass-deleting credentials"
  → Personal, specific number, curiosity

✓ "You're at 80% of your free tier"
  → Direct, relevant, actionable
```

### Bad Subject Lines

```
✗ "Newsletter #47"
  → No value proposition

✗ "Exciting news from SecretStash!"
  → Vague, hype without substance

✗ "Don't miss out on this limited time offer!!!"
  → Spammy, desperate

✗ "Quick question"
  → Bait-and-switch if there's no question

✗ "Checking in"
  → No value, wastes recipient's time
```

### Length Guidelines

- **Mobile-optimized:** 30-40 characters (shows fully)
- **Standard:** 40-60 characters
- **Max:** 70 characters (truncated on most clients)

### Preview Text

The preview text (preheader) is your second headline. Use it.

```
Subject: Your API keys are in Slack (again)
Preview: Here's how to fix it in 5 minutes

Subject: New: Environments are here
Preview: Separate dev, staging, and prod secrets
```

### A/B Testing Priorities

1. Curiosity vs direct benefit
2. With vs without personalization
3. Question vs statement
4. With vs without emoji
5. Short vs long

### Anti-Patterns

- ALL CAPS (feels like shouting)
- Multiple exclamation points!!!
- Misleading subjects (destroys trust)
- "Re:" or "Fwd:" when it's not (deceptive)
- Generic subjects for personalized content
