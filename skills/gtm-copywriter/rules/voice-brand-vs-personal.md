## Brand Voice vs Personal Voice

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Brand and personal voices serve different purposes. Don't mix them.

### Brand Voice

Represents the company. Consistent across all touchpoints.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses "we" and company name
- Consistent regardless of author
- Professional but not stiff
- Focuses on customer outcomes

**Good Example:**
```
We built SecretStash because developers deserved better than .env files
in Slack DMs. Today, 50,000 teams trust us with their secrets.
```

**Bad Example:**
```
I think our product is really great and you should try it!
We're super excited about this feature I worked on.
```

### Personal Voice

Represents an individual. Builds human connection and thought leadership.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses "I" and first name
- Reflects individual personality and opinions
- More vulnerable, more opinionated
- Shares personal experiences and learnings

**Good Example:**
```
I've mass-deleted credentials from Slack 3 times this year.
Each time I swore I'd fix our secrets management.
Finally did. Here's what I learned building it.
```

**Bad Example:**
```
SecretStash is excited to announce that we have solved secrets management.
Our team has worked hard on this solution.
```

### When to Use Each

| Context | Voice |
|---------|-------|
| Product website | Brand |
| Help docs | Brand |
| Marketing emails | Brand (or founder personal for early-stage) |
| LinkedIn (company page) | Brand |
| LinkedIn (personal profile) | Personal |
| Twitter/X (company) | Brand conversational |
| Twitter/X (founder/employee) | Personal |
| Blog (company blog) | Brand or attributed personal |
| Newsletter | Either (be consistent) |

### Mixing Them (Carefully)

Early-stage startups often blur the line intentionally:

```
Hey, it's Nick from SecretStash.

I wanted to personally let you know we just shipped environments—
the feature you asked for 47 times. (Yes, I counted.)

We're a small team, and your feedback shapes what we build.
Keep it coming.

— Nick
```

This works because it's clearly personal but represents the brand.

### Anti-Pattern

Switching voice mid-piece. If you start personal, stay personal. If you start brand, stay brand.
