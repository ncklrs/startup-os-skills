## Sales Stages and Exit Criteria

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Sales stages create shared language and predictability. Without clear exit criteria, your pipeline becomes a fantasy — deals sit in stages they shouldn't be in, forecasts are meaningless, and reps waste time on stuck opportunities.

### Stage Design Principles

1. **Buyer-centric** — Stages reflect where the buyer is, not what you've done
2. **Objectively verifiable** — Exit criteria can be proven, not assumed
3. **Mutually exclusive** — A deal can only be in one stage
4. **Progressive probability** — Each stage represents higher likelihood
5. **Action-oriented** — Clear next steps at each stage

### Standard B2B SaaS Stage Model

| Stage | Name | Exit Criteria | Probability | Typical Duration |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| 0 | **Prospect** | Contact identified, initial outreach | 5% | N/A |
| 1 | **Discovery** | Meeting held, pain confirmed, qualification started | 10% | 1-2 weeks |
| 2 | **Qualified** | MEDDIC complete, champion identified, next steps agreed | 20% | 2-4 weeks |
| 3 | **Evaluation** | Technical validation, POC or trial in progress | 40% | 2-6 weeks |
| 4 | **Proposal** | Pricing/SOW delivered, terms under review | 60% | 1-3 weeks |
| 5 | **Negotiation** | Verbal commit, contract redlines in progress | 80% | 1-2 weeks |
| 6 | **Closed Won** | Contract signed, deal booked | 100% | - |
| 7 | **Closed Lost** | Deal ended, reason documented | 0% | - |

### Detailed Exit Criteria

#### Stage 1: Discovery → Qualified

**Required to Exit:**
```
□ First meeting completed
□ Key stakeholders identified (names, titles, roles)
□ Pain/challenge articulated by prospect (not assumed)
□ Current state documented
□ Rough budget range confirmed (at least "we have budget")
□ Timeline discussed (even if "no rush")
□ Competitive landscape understood
□ Next step scheduled with specific date
```

**Verification Method:**
- Call recording reviewed
- Notes documented in CRM
- Follow-up email sent confirming understanding

#### Stage 2: Qualified → Evaluation

**Required to Exit:**
```
□ MEDDIC/qualification framework fully scored
□ Economic buyer identified by name
□ Decision process documented (steps, timeline, people)
□ Decision criteria documented (written, not verbal)
□ Champion confirmed (willing to advocate, share info)
□ Compelling event identified (why now?)
□ Technical requirements scoped
□ Evaluation plan agreed (POC scope, success criteria)
```

**Verification Method:**
- MEDDIC score > 20/30
- Written evaluation plan sent and acknowledged
- Multi-threaded (3+ contacts engaged)

#### Stage 3: Evaluation → Proposal

**Required to Exit:**
```
□ Technical validation complete
□ POC/trial success criteria met
□ Security/compliance review passed (if applicable)

```

**Verification Method:**
- POC success documented
- Positive email/feedback from champion
- Pricing meeting scheduled or held

#### Stage 4: Proposal → Negotiation

**Required to Exit:**
```
□ Formal proposal/quote delivered
□ Proposal reviewed with stakeholders
□ Pricing feedback received
□ Verbal "we want to move forward"
□ Contract terms shared
□ Procurement process initiated
□ Legal/finance contacts introduced
□ Close date confirmed
```

**Verification Method:**
- Proposal delivery confirmed
- "We're moving forward" in writing
- Contract shared

#### Stage 5: Negotiation → Closed Won

**Required to Exit:**
```
□ Final pricing agreed
□ Contract redlines resolved
□ Signature authority confirmed
□ Expected signature date confirmed
□ PO/payment method confirmed (if applicable)
```

**Verification Method:**
- Clean contract ready for signature
- Signature date within 14 days

### Stage Velocity Benchmarks

| Segment | Discovery → Qualified | Qualified → Eval | Eval → Proposal | Proposal → Close |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **SMB** | 5 days | 7 days | 10 days | 5 days |
| **Mid-Market** | 14 days | 21 days | 30 days | 14 days |
| **Enterprise** | 30 days | 45 days | 60 days | 30 days |
| **Strategic** | 45 days | 90 days | 90 days | 45 days |

### Good Stage Management

```
Proper Stage Progression:

Day 1 - Discovery call completed
- Pain confirmed: Manual reporting taking 10+ hours/week
- Stakeholders: Director of Ops (evaluator), VP Ops (buyer)
- Timeline: Q4 budget, need solution by December
- Notes: Documented, recording saved
→ Advanced to Stage 1 (Discovery)

Day 8 - Qualification complete
- MEDDIC Score: 24/30
- Champion: Director of Ops, sponsored last 2 tool purchases
- Decision: VP Ops approves up to $50K, above needs CFO
- Process: Technical eval → Pilot → Business case → Sign
- Criteria: Written list of 8 requirements shared
→ Advanced to Stage 2 (Qualified)

Why this works:
✓ Each advancement has documented evidence
✓ Buyer actions, not seller actions, drive progression
✓ Objectively verifiable criteria met
```

### Bad Stage Management

```
Stage Inflation (Anti-Pattern):

Day 1: Demo completed → Moved to "Evaluation" (Stage 3)
Rationale: "They loved the demo!"

Problem:
✗ No qualification completed
✗ No champion identified
✗ No decision process understood
✗ "Love" is not an exit criteria
✗ Deal now inflates pipeline and forecast

Reality: This deal should be Stage 1 at best
```

```
Zombie Deal (Anti-Pattern):

Deal has been in "Proposal" (Stage 4) for 90 days
Last contact: 45 days ago
Notes: "Following up, waiting on their timeline"

Problem:
✗ No buyer activity for 45 days
✗ Original close date passed
✗ No explanation for stall
✗ Should be moved to Lost or back to earlier stage
```

### Pipeline Hygiene Rules

**Weekly Deal Review Questions:**

| Check | Question | Action if No |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Activity | Buyer contact in last 14 days? | Reach out or re-stage |
| Progression | Movement in last 30 days? | Diagnose stall or remove |
| Close Date | Still achievable? | Update or push |
| Champion | Still engaged? | Re-confirm or find new one |
| Competition | Still winning? | Re-assess position |

**Automatic Stage Rules:**

```
Auto-downgrade triggers:
- No activity for 30 days → Flag for review
- No activity for 45 days → Move back one stage
- No activity for 60 days → Move to Lost
- Close date missed by 30+ days → Manager review required

Auto-lost triggers:
- Explicit "we chose competitor"
- Explicit "project cancelled"
- Contact churned, no replacement
- Company went out of business
```

### Closed Lost Analysis

Every lost deal should capture:

| Field | Options | Use |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Primary Reason | Price, Feature Gap, Competition, Timing, No Decision, Other | Trend analysis |
| Competitor Won | Dropdown of competitors | Competitive intelligence |
| Stage Lost | Where in funnel | Conversion analysis |
| Winnable | Yes/No/Maybe | Coach on misread deals |
| Detailed Notes | Free text | Pattern recognition |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Happy staging** — Moving deals forward based on hope
- **Demo = qualified** — Confusing interest with qualification
- **No backward movement** — Stages only move forward
- **Stale close dates** — Never updating unrealistic dates
- **Single-thread deals in late stages** — Champion leaves, deal dies
- **Ignoring lost analysis** — Missing the learning opportunity
