## Virtual Event Production

**Impact: HIGH**

Virtual and hybrid events offer global reach and scalability, but competing with Netflix for attention requires production quality and engagement innovation. Treating virtual like in-person doesn't work.

### Virtual Event Format Spectrum

| Format | Scale | Production Level | Engagement Model |
|--------|-------|------------------|------------------|
| **Single webinar** | 50-500 | Low | Passive + Q&A |
| **Webinar series** | 100-1000 | Low-Medium | Progressive learning |
| **Virtual summit** | 500-5000 | Medium | Multi-track, networking |
| **Virtual conference** | 1000-10000 | High | Full experience, sponsors |
| **Hybrid event** | Varies | Very High | Dual audiences |

### Platform Selection Criteria

| Criteria | Weight | Questions |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Engagement features** | 25% | Networking, chat, polls, Q&A, breakouts? |
| **Production quality** | 20% | Stream quality, branding, multi-speaker? |
| **Analytics** | 20% | Attendee tracking, session data, exports? |
| **Integration** | 15% | CRM, marketing automation, calendar? |
| **Scalability** | 10% | Concurrent users, global distribution? |
| **Cost** | 10% | Per-user vs flat, hidden fees? |

### Platform Comparison

| Platform | Best For | Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Hopin** | Large virtual summits | Networking features | Can feel complex |
| **Zoom Events** | Simple virtual events | Familiar interface | Limited engagement |
| **Goldcast** | B2B marketing events | CRM integration | Higher price point |
| **Welcome** | High-end experiences | Premium feel | Production-heavy |
| **Airmeet** | Community events | Social features | Smaller scale |
| **On24** | Webinar series | Analytics depth | Less interactive |
| **StreamYard** | Multi-streaming | Easy production | Not event-focused |

### Virtual Summit Structure

```
Day 1: Industry Focus
09:00 — Opening keynote (30 min)
09:45 — Track 1 sessions (3 × 30 min)
11:00 — Networking break (30 min)
11:30 — Track 2 sessions (3 × 30 min)
13:00 — Lunch keynote/sponsor (30 min)
13:45 — Workshop sessions (2 × 45 min)
15:15 — Closing panel (30 min)
15:45 — Virtual happy hour/networking

Total: 7 hours (but attendees cherry-pick)
```

### Production Quality Levels

| Level | Investment | When to Use |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Basic** | Webcam, slides | Internal events, small webinars |
| **Professional** | Ring light, external mic, branded background | Standard webinars |
| **Studio** | Multi-camera, professional audio, lower thirds | Virtual summits |
| **Broadcast** | Production crew, live switching, pre-produced segments | Flagship events |

### Good Virtual Event Practices

```
✓ Pre-record high-stakes content, go live for Q&A
  → Best of both: polished content + real interaction

✓ Build in forced networking
  → "Coffee chat" feature pairs attendees automatically

✓ Multiple engagement touchpoints per hour
  → Poll, chat prompt, Q&A, resource drop

✓ Shorter sessions than in-person
  → 30 min virtual = 60 min in-person attention span

✓ On-demand replay strategy from day 1
  → 60% of registrants watch on-demand, not live

✓ Speaker preparation specific to virtual
  → Practice with the platform, not just content
```

### Bad Virtual Event Practices

```
✗ Back-to-back sessions with no breaks
  → Zoom fatigue is real, attendance drops

✗ Treating virtual attendees as passive viewers
  → They have tabs, phones, and Netflix competing

✗ One-size-fits-all timing
  → Global event at 9am PST = 1am in Asia

✗ Ignoring the chat
  → Unanswered questions kill engagement

✗ No mobile optimization
  → 20-30% watch on phones

✗ Complex platform with no orientation
  → Attendees get lost, miss content
```

### Hybrid Event Considerations

| Element | In-Person | Virtual | Hybrid Approach |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Networking** | Hallway conversations | Chat, video rooms | Virtual lounges + streaming |
| **Q&A** | Microphones | Chat/raise hand | Combined feed, moderator |
| **Exhibits** | Physical booths | Virtual booths | Virtual booth + live demos |
| **Content** | Full attention | Competing distractions | Shorter, punchier virtual |
| **Swag** | Handed out | Shipped | Virtual attendee kits shipped |

### Virtual Engagement Tactics

| Tactic | Engagement Lift | Effort |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Live polling** | +30% engagement | Low |
| **Gamification/points** | +40% session completion | Medium |
| **Breakout rooms** | +50% networking | Medium |
| **Live Q&A with speaker** | +25% retention | Low |
| **AI-powered matchmaking** | +35% meetings | High |
| **Watch parties** | +20% attendance | Low |
| **Interactive workshops** | +60% satisfaction | High |

### Virtual Event Timeline

| Timeframe | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| **12 weeks** | Platform selection, speaker outreach |
| **8 weeks** | Content development, sponsorship sales |
| **6 weeks** | Registration opens, promotion begins |
| **4 weeks** | Speaker dry runs, content finalization |
| **2 weeks** | Technical testing, staff training |
| **1 week** | Final rehearsals, attendee communications |
| **Day before** | Full tech check, green room prep |
| **Event day** | Production team on call, real-time support |
| **Day after** | Recording processing, immediate follow-up |

### Technical Requirements Checklist

**For Speakers:**
- [ ] Wired internet connection (ethernet)

### Attendee Experience Design

```
Pre-event:
├── Platform access email (3 days before)
├── Agenda with personal schedule builder
├── Speaker preview content
└── Networking profile setup prompts

During event:
├── Clear navigation
├── Session reminders (15 min before)
├── Easy chat/Q&A access
├── Resource library
└── Help desk/support chat

Post-event:
├── On-demand access (immediate)
├── Personalized content recommendations
├── Connection request follow-ups
└── Certificate of attendance
```

### Virtual Event Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Peak concurrent** | Live interest | 40-50% of registrants |
| **Avg session attendance** | Content relevance | 60%+ of peak |
| **Avg watch time** | Engagement quality | 70%+ of session length |
| **Networking connections** | Community building | 3+ per attendee |
| **On-demand views** | Content longevity | 1.5x live attendance |
| **Sponsor booth visits** | Sponsor ROI | 20%+ of attendees |

### Anti-Patterns

- **In-person agenda copy-paste** — Virtual needs different pacing
- **Single timezone bias** — Global events need staggered sessions
- **Chat moderation neglect** — Unanswered questions, spam, chaos
- **Speaker tech surprises** — No dry runs, production issues live
- **Engagement afterthought** — Building interaction in at the end
- **No backup plan** — Speaker internet fails, no contingency
- **Over-complicated platform** — Attendees can't navigate
- **Ignoring on-demand** — 50%+ engagement happens post-event
