# Sales Leader

Strategic sales expertise for building and scaling high-performance B2B sales organizations — from strategy and hiring to process design and deal execution.

## Philosophy

Sales is not about pushing products. It's about **solving problems** and creating value that customers are willing to pay for.

The best sales organizations:
1. **Qualify ruthlessly** — Time is your scarcest resource

3. **Build repeatable processes** — Champions create playbooks, not chaos
4. **Forecast accurately** — Pipeline truth enables business planning
