### Types of Comparison Pages

|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct comparison** | /vs/[competitor] | /vs/notion |
| **Alternatives page** | /alternatives/[competitor] | /alternatives/asana |
| **Category comparison** | /compare/[category] | /compare/project-management |
| **Migration page** | /switch-from/[competitor] | /switch-from/jira |

### Headline Formulas

| Formula | Example | Tone |
|---------|---------|------|
| **[You] vs [Them]** | "Acme vs Notion: Which is right for you?" | Balanced |
| **Alternative question** | "Looking for a Notion alternative?" | Intent-matching |
| **Switching focus** | "Switching from Notion? Here's what to know" | Action-oriented |
| **Comparison focus** | "How Acme compares to Notion" | Educational |

### Good Comparison Headlines

```
✓ "Acme vs Notion: A detailed comparison"
  → Clear, SEO-friendly, balanced

✓ "The Notion alternative built for speed"
  → Differentiator in headline

✓ "Thinking about switching from Asana?"
  → Speaks to visitor intent

✓ "Acme vs Jira: Which project tool fits your team?"
  → Helpful framing, not adversarial
```

### Bad Comparison Headlines

```
✗ "Why Acme is better than Notion"
  → Sounds biased, reduces trust

✗ "Acme destroys the competition"
  → Aggressive, unprofessional

✗ "Competitor Comparison"
  → Generic, no SEO value

✗ "The truth about Notion"
  → Sounds like attack marketing
```

### TL;DR Summary Approach

Provide an honest, scannable summary:

```
✓ Good TL;DR:
   "Acme and Notion both help teams organize work. The key differences:
   Acme is faster and built for developers. Notion offers more
   flexibility for non-technical teams. If speed and integrations
   matter most, choose Acme. If customization is your priority,
   Notion might be better."

✗ Bad TL;DR:
   "Acme is simply better than Notion in every way. Here's why you
   should switch immediately."
   → One-sided, loses credibility
```

### Comparison Table Best Practices

| Element | Do | Don't |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Features** | Include genuine differentiators | Pad with irrelevant features you win |
| **Ratings** | Use checkmarks, not scores | Make up arbitrary scores |
| **Honesty** | Show where competitor wins | Hide their strengths |
| **Specificity** | "Unlimited" vs "10 per month" | "Good" vs "Bad" |
| **Freshness** | Date the comparison, keep updated | Let it get stale |

### Good Comparison Table

```
✓ Feature                    Acme        Notion
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────
  Real-time collaboration    ✓           ✓
  Unlimited storage          ✓           ✓ (paid)
  API access                 ✓           ✓
  Offline mode               ✓           Limited
  Custom integrations        50+         200+
  Starting price             Free        Free
  Speed/Performance          Very fast   Moderate
  Learning curve             Low         Moderate
  Mobile app                 Native      Native
```

### Bad Comparison Table

```
✗ Feature                    Acme        Competitor
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────
  Quality                    Excellent   Poor
  Value                      Great       Bad
  Support                    Amazing     Terrible
  Innovation                 10/10       2/10
  → Subjective, biased, lacks specifics
```

### Advantage Sections

Structure each advantage as:
1. **Clear benefit headline**
2. **Why it matters** (1-2 sentences)
3. **Specific evidence** (metric, quote, or example)

```
✓ "Ship 3x faster with native Git integration"
   Acme syncs directly with your repos. No manual updates, no context
   switching. Every change is tracked automatically.

   "We cut our deploy time from 45 minutes to 12 minutes after
   switching from Notion." — VP Engineering, TechCorp
```

### "When to Choose [Competitor]" Section

This counterintuitive section builds trust:

```
✓ "When Notion might be better for you:

   • You need a wiki + project management in one tool
   • Your team is primarily non-technical
   • You want maximum customization flexibility
   • You're already deeply embedded in Notion's ecosystem

   We're not the right fit for everyone, and that's okay. If these
   describe you, Notion might serve you better."
```

### Why This Works

| Approach | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Acknowledging competitor strengths | Builds trust, shows confidence |
| Helping people self-select out | Reduces churn, improves fit |
| Being honest | Differentiates from biased competitors |
| Showing maturity | Signals professionalism |

### Switching Story Format

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CUSTOMER SWITCHING STORY                           │
│                                                    │
│ "[Company] switched from [Competitor] to [You]"    │
│                                                    │
│ • Why they switched                                │
│ • How the migration went                           │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Good Switching Story

```
✓ "How Linear's engineering team switched from Jira"

   "We loved Jira's power, but it was slowing us down. Every sprint
   planning took hours. After switching to Acme, we cut planning time
   by 60% and actually started enjoying standups."

   Migration time: 1 week for 50-person team
   Data imported: 100% (projects, issues, history)
   Result: 60% faster sprint planning

   — Marcus Chen, Engineering Manager, Linear
```

### Migration Support Section

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Import tools** | "One-click import from [Competitor]" |
| **Data migration** | "We'll migrate your data for free" |
| **Time estimate** | "Most teams are up and running in 2 hours" |
| **Support offer** | "Our team will help you switch" |
| **Risk reduction** | "Keep your [Competitor] account during transition" |

### Good Migration Copy

```
✓ "Switching is easier than you think"

   1. Export your data from Notion (we'll show you how)
   2. Import with one click — everything comes over
   3. Invite your team — they'll feel at home immediately

   Average migration time: 47 minutes
   Data loss: None. Ever.
