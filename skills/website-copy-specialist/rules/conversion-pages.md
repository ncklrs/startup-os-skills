## Demo Request and Contact Pages

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Demo and contact pages are conversion endpoints. Every word either reduces friction or adds it. These pages should make taking action feel easy, valuable, and low-risk.

### Types of Conversion Pages

| Page Type | Purpose | Target Visitor |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Demo request** | Book a call with sales | Qualified, ready to evaluate |
| **Contact sales** | Start a sales conversation | Enterprise, complex needs |
| **Get started** | Begin self-serve signup | Ready to try |
| **Talk to us** | General inquiry | Various intent levels |
| **Get a quote** | Custom pricing | Enterprise buyers |

### Demo Page Headlines

| Formula | Example | Tone |
|---------|---------|------|
| **See [Product] in action** | "See Acme in action" | Direct |
| **Get a personalized demo** | "Get a personalized walkthrough" | White-glove |
| **[Outcome] in [Time]** | "See how to ship 3x faster in 30 minutes" | Value-focused |
| **Let us show you** | "Let us show you what's possible" | Consultative |

### Good Demo Headlines

```
✓ "See how Acme can help your team ship faster"
  → Outcome-focused, personalized

✓ "Get a personalized demo in 30 minutes"
  → Clear time commitment

✓ "Let's find the right solution for your team"
  → Consultative, not pushy

✓ "Your questions, answered live"
  → Addresses the value of human interaction
```

### Bad Demo Headlines

```
✗ "Request a Demo"
  → Zero value proposition

✗ "Contact Us"
  → Generic, cold

✗ "Fill Out This Form to Get Started"
  → Focuses on the task, not the value

✗ "Schedule Your Personalized AI-Powered Demo Experience"
  → Over-engineered, buzzwordy
```

### Value Proposition for Demos

Tell them what they'll get:

```
✓ "In your 30-minute demo, you'll:"
   • See Acme configured for your use case
   • Get answers to your specific questions
   • Learn about pricing and implementation
   • Receive a custom proposal (if you want one)

✓ "What to expect:"
   • A quick needs assessment (5 min)
   • A personalized walkthrough (20 min)
   • Q&A and next steps (5 min)
   • No pressure, no hard sell
```

### Bad Value Propositions

```
✗ "Request a demo today!"
   → No information about what they get

✗ "Our team will reach out to discuss your needs"
   → Vague, feels like entering a sales funnel

✗ "Fill out the form to begin your journey with us"
   → Corporate speak, no specifics
```

### Form Field Strategy

| Field | Essential? | Why Include |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Email** | Yes | Primary contact |
| **First name** | Yes | Personalization |
| **Last name** | Often | Professional setting |
| **Company** | Often | Qualification |
| **Company size** | Sometimes | Routing/qualification |
| **Phone** | Sometimes | Follow-up option |
| **Role/title** | Sometimes | Personalization |
| **Message** | Rarely | Let them share context |

### Optimal Form Length

| Context | Recommended Fields | Conversion Impact |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **High volume** | 2-3 fields | Maximum submissions |
| **Qualified leads** | 4-5 fields | Better quality |
| **Enterprise** | 5-7 fields | Appropriate friction |
| **Simple contact** | 2-3 fields | Maximize response |

### Good Form Design

```
✓ First name [_____________]
   Work email [_____________]
   Company    [_____________]
   Company size [Dropdown: 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 200+]

   [ Book my demo ]

   We'll respond within 24 hours
```

### Bad Form Design

```
✗ 15 fields including:
   - Fax number
   - How did you hear about us (required)
   - Describe your challenges in detail (required)
   - Budget range (required)
   - Timeline (required)
   → Too much friction, feels like an interrogation
```

### Submit Button Copy

| Generic (Avoid) | Specific (Better) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Submit" | "Book my demo" |
| "Send" | "Get in touch" |
| "Contact" | "Request a callback" |
| "Next" | "Schedule a time" |

### Good Submit Buttons

```
✓ "Book my demo"
✓ "Request my personalized demo"
✓ "Talk to our team"
✓ "Get my custom quote"
✓ "Start the conversation"
```

### Social Proof Placement

| Location | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Near form** | Logo bar | Trust building |
| **Below headline** | Single stat | Social validation |
| **Beside form** | Testimonial | Reduce anxiety |
| **Footer area** | Trust badges | Security assurance |

### Good Social Proof

```
✓ "Join 2,000+ teams who've made the switch"
   [Stripe logo] [Figma logo] [Linear logo]

✓ "★★★★★ 4.9/5 on G2 (500+ reviews)"

✓ "Trusted by teams at companies you know"
   [Logo bar of recognizable brands]

✓ Quote: "The best decision we made this year."
   — VP Engineering, Series B Startup
```

### Objection Handling Section

Address common hesitations:

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Will I get spammed?" | "No spam, just one follow-up email" |
| "How long will this take?" | "30 minutes, you can end early anytime" |
| "Is this a sales pitch?" | "It's a conversation, not a pitch" |
| "What if I'm not ready to buy?" | "Most people book demos to learn, not buy" |

### Good FAQ Section

```
✓ "What happens after I submit?"
   We'll email you within 24 hours to schedule a time that works.
   If you don't see our email, check spam (and mark us safe!).

✓ "What if I'm just exploring?"
   That's totally fine. Most demos are exploratory.
   No pressure to make any decisions.

✓ "Can I bring my team?"
   Absolutely. Invite anyone who'd find the demo useful.
```

### Alternative Path Section

Always offer an alternative for those not ready:

```
✓ "Not ready for a call?"
   • Watch a 5-minute product tour
   • Explore our documentation
   • Start a free trial

✓ "Prefer to self-serve?"
   [Start free trial — no credit card required]
```

| **Form length** | 4-6 fields | 2-4 fields |
| **Expectation** | Meeting scheduled | Response received |
| **CTA** | "Book demo" | "Send message" |
| **Response time** | 24 hours to schedule | 1-2 business days |

### Post-Submission Experience

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **Confirmation message** | "Thanks! We'll be in touch within 24 hours" |
| **Next steps** | "Check your email for confirmation" |
| **While you wait** | "Explore our resources" / "See product tour" |
| **Confirmation email** | Immediate, with calendar link or next steps |

### Conversion Page Checklist

- [ ] Headline communicates value, not just action
- [ ] Form asks only essential questions
- [ ] Submit button is specific and action-oriented
- [ ] Social proof visible near form
- [ ] Response time expectation set
- [ ] Objections addressed (FAQ or inline)
- [ ] Alternative path for non-ready visitors
- [ ] Mobile-optimized form and CTA
- [ ] Confirmation message/page after submission
- [ ] Follow-up email automated

### Anti-Patterns

- **"Submit" buttons** — Use specific, value-oriented copy
- **Too many fields** — Every field costs conversions
- **No response expectation** — People wonder if it worked
- **Missing social proof** — Trust is crucial at conversion
- **Buried form** — Above fold, easy to find
- **No alternative** — Offer options for different readiness
- **Generic headline** — "Contact Us" is a missed opportunity
- **Required phone** — Many people won't give phone numbers
- **CAPTCHA friction** — Use invisible alternatives if possible
- **No mobile optimization** — Thumb-friendly fields and buttons
