## VSL Hook Formulas and Patterns

**Impact: CRITICAL**

The first 3-5 seconds determine whether viewers watch or scroll. In VSL and product videos, the hook is the most critical element. 80% of your video's success depends on nailing this moment.

## Hook Performance Benchmarks

| Quality | Watch-through at 5s | Characteristics |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Excellent** | 70%+ | Immediate value, clear relevance, strong emotion |
| **Good** | 50-70% | Clear problem/benefit, adequate relevance |
| **Fair** | 30-50% | Generic, slow build, unclear relevance |
| **Poor** | <30% | No hook, company-focused, slow start |

## The 6 Hook Archetypes

### 1. Question Hook

**When to use**: Curiosity-driven products, universal problems

**Formula**: "What if [desired outcome] was [surprisingly easy/fast]?"

**Good Example**:
```
On-Screen Copy:
"What if video editing took 5 minutes instead of 5 hours?"

Visual: Split screen
  Left: Person frustrated at complex editing timeline
  Right: Same person smiling with simple interface

Psychology:
- Immediately relatable problem (time-consuming editing)
- Creates curiosity (how could it be that fast?)
- Implies transformation is possible

Timing: 0-4s
```

**Bad Example**:
```
"What is our video editing platform?"

Why it fails:
- Not a question viewers have
- No curiosity or desire triggered
- Company-focused, not viewer-focused
```

### 2. Problem Hook

**When to use**: Clear, painful problem your audience knows they have

**Formula**: "[Negative feeling] by [pain point] while [frustrating reality]?"

**Good Example**:
```
On-Screen Copy:
"Losing deals because your demos take too long to set up?"

Visual:
- Salesperson struggling with demo that won't load
- Impatient prospect checking phone
- Clock ticking

Psychology:
- Specific pain (demo setup time)
- Real consequence (losing deals)
- Immediate identification (prospect knows this feeling)

Timing: 0-3s
```

**Bad Example**:
```
"Demos can be challenging."

Why it fails:
- Too vague (what kind of challenges?)
- No urgency or emotion
- Sounds like corporate speak
```

### 3. Curiosity Hook

**When to use**: Innovative products, novel mechanisms, contrarian approaches

**Formula**: "This [simple/unexpected thing] [produced surprising result]"

**Good Example**:
```
On-Screen Copy:
"One calendar setting eliminated 40% of our meetings"

Visual:
- Simple calendar toggle switch
- Meetings disappearing from screen
- Person gaining hours back in calendar

Psychology:
- Curiosity gap (what's the setting?)
- Specific, believable result (40%, not 90%)
- Universal desire (fewer meetings)

Timing: 0-4s
```

**Bad Example**:
```
"You won't believe what happened next..."

Why it fails:
- Clickbait that creates distrust
- No specific value proposition
- Overused pattern viewers tune out
```

### 4. Social Proof Hook

**When to use**: Strong traction, well-known customers, impressive numbers

**Formula**: "[Impressive number] [authority figures/companies] already [specific outcome]"

**Good Example**:
```
On-Screen Copy:
"27,000 engineering teams ship code 3x faster"

Visual:
- Logos of recognizable tech companies
- Counter rapidly increasing
- Code being deployed

Psychology:
- Credibility through numbers (27k teams)
- Specific outcome (3x faster)
- FOMO (others are already benefiting)

Timing: 0-5s
```

**Bad Example**:
```
"Thousands of satisfied customers"

Why it fails:
- Vague (thousands could be 2,000 or 900,000)
- Generic (satisfied doesn't convey specific value)
- Sounds like every company ever
```

### 5. Demonstration Hook

**When to use**: Visual products, impressive results, "seeing is believing"

**Formula**: Show the impressive result immediately, explain later

**Good Example**:
```
On-Screen Copy:
[None at first - visual speaks]
"0 to production-ready app in 60 seconds"

Visual:
- Time-lapse of blank screen → full application
- Real-time counter showing: 00:00 to 01:00
- Actual working product at end

Psychology:
- Proof through demonstration
- Specific, measurable claim (60 seconds)
- "I want that" reaction

Timing: 0-6s (full demonstration)
```

**Bad Example**:
```
"Our platform is really fast"

Why it fails:
- Tell instead of show
- Subjective claim (how fast is "really fast"?)
- No proof or demonstration
```

### 6. Pattern Interrupt Hook

**When to use**: Crowded markets, need to break through noise, bold brand

**Formula**: Start with something unexpected, then connect to value

**Good Example**:
```
On-Screen Copy:
"Delete your entire marketing stack"
[pause]
"Keep this one tool instead"

Visual:
- Multiple app icons falling/deleting
- One app remaining, glowing
- Clean, simple interface

Psychology:
- Breaks expectation (usually adding tools, not deleting)
- Creates cognitive tension (wait, delete everything?)
- Promises simplification

Timing: 0-7s (includes pause for impact)
```

**Bad Example**:
```
Random unrelated visual: Cat wearing sunglasses
"Now let's talk about our CRM..."

Why it fails:
- Interrupt has no connection to value
- Feels gimmicky, not strategic
- Damages credibility
```

## Hook Construction Rules

### 1. Relevance First

**Good**: "Tired of manually copying data between systems?"
- Specific problem
- Target audience knows immediately if this is for them

**Bad**: "Want to be more productive?"
- Too generic
- Could apply to anything

### 2. Specificity Over Vagueness

**Good**: "Cut your ad spend by 40% in 30 days"
- Specific metric (40%)
- Specific timeframe (30 days)

**Bad**: "Save money on advertising"
- No specifics
- Every tool claims this

### 3. "You" Language

**Good**: "You're spending 15 hours/week on reports"
- Addresses viewer directly
- Makes it personal

**Bad**: "Companies spend time on reports"
- Third person
- Not personal

### 4. One Hook, One Message

**Good**: Focus entirely on one pain point or benefit

**Bad**: "Are you tired of slow software, bad support, and high prices?"
- Too many messages
- Dilutes impact

## Hook Testing Framework

Before finalizing a hook, test against these criteria:

### The 3-Second Scroll Test
- [ ] Could this grab attention mid-scroll?
- [ ] Clear what it's about instantly?
- [ ] Obvious who it's for?

### The Mute Test
- [ ] Works without sound?
- [ ] Visual alone conveys value?
- [ ] Text readable and impactful?

### The Relevance Test
- [ ] Target audience immediately knows "this is for me"?
- [ ] Problem/benefit is specific, not generic?
- [ ] Passes the "so what?" test?

### The Emotion Test
- [ ] Triggers an emotion (curiosity, frustration, hope, FOMO)?
- [ ] Emotion is appropriate for brand and product?
- [ ] Not manipulative or dishonest?

## Hook + Scene 2 Combinations

The hook sets up expectations. Scene 2 must deliver on the promise.

### Good Combination
```
Hook (0-3s): "Spending 20 hours/week in meetings?"
Scene 2 (3-10s): Show calendar before/after with hours reclaimed

Hook creates problem awareness
Scene 2 shows transformation is possible
```

### Bad Combination
```
Hook (0-3s): "Want better meetings?"
Scene 2 (3-10s): Logo animation and company name

Hook asks question
Scene 2 ignores it, shows branding instead
```

## Hook Length Guidelines

| Video Duration | Hook Duration | Max % of Video |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| 15-30s | 2-4s | 15-20% |
| 30-60s | 3-5s | 10-15% |
| 60-90s | 4-6s | 5-10% |
| 90-180s | 5-8s | 5-7% |
| 3-10min | 8-15s | 3-5% |

**Principle**: Shorter videos need faster hooks. Longer videos can build slightly more.

## Industry-Specific Hook Examples

### SaaS B2B
```
Problem Hook:
"Sales reps spending 4 hours/day on admin instead of selling?"

Social Proof Hook:
"1,200 sales teams closed 35% more deals last quarter"

Curiosity Hook:
"One Slack integration eliminated our CRM data entry"
```

### Consumer Product
```
Demonstration Hook:
[Show transformation: messy → organized in 10 seconds]

Question Hook:
"What if getting organized actually took 5 minutes?"

Social Proof Hook:
"50,000 homes decluttered in 30 days"
```

### Education/Course
```
Problem Hook:
"Stuck in tutorial hell, building nothing real?"

Social Proof Hook:
"2,000 developers landed jobs after this 8-week program"

Curiosity Hook:
"This learning method works backwards from real projects"
```

### App/Mobile
```
Demonstration Hook:
[Show app in action: problem → solved in seconds]

Question Hook:
"What if tracking calories didn't feel like homework?"

Pattern Interrupt Hook:
"Delete your fitness apps. Keep this one."
```

## Advanced Hook Techniques

### The Double Hook

Use two hooks in sequence when needed:

```
Hook 1 (0-2s): Visual pattern interrupt
  [Fast-motion chaos]

Hook 2 (2-5s): Problem question
  "Drowning in project management tools?"

Technique: Visual grabs attention, copy creates relevance
```

### The Silent Hook

Designed for muted autoplay:

```
Visual Hook (0-4s):
  - Bold text: "20 hours/week" → "2 hours/week"
  - No explanation needed
  - Numbers + transformation clear visually

Perfect for social feed autoplay
```

### The Stat Stack Hook

Build credibility through rapid stats:

```
Hook (0-6s):
"40,000 videos created
12 million views generated
$2.3M in revenue attributed"

Visual: Numbers counting up rapidly
Then: "All from one platform"

Overwhelm with proof, then promise simplicity
```
