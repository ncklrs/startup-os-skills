## Call-to-Action Optimization

**Impact: HIGH**

The CTA is where conversion happens. Everything before it builds to this moment. A weak CTA wastes everything that came before.

## CTA Placement Strategy

### Primary CTA Timing

| Video Length | Primary CTA | Secondary CTA (Optional) |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 15-30s | 80-90% (24-27s) | None |
| 30-60s | 85-95% (51-57s) | 50% (soft tease) |
| 60-90s | 85-95% (77-86s) | 60% (soft tease) |
| 90-180s | 90-95% (162-171s) | 50%, 70% (teases) |
| 3-10min | 95-98% (570-588s) | Every 90s (teases) |

### The Two-CTA Strategy

For videos over 60s, use multiple CTAs:

**Soft CTA (Mid-video)**:
- Plant the seed
- Low pressure
- "Learn more" or "See how it works"

**Hard CTA (End)**:
- Clear, specific action
- Remove friction
- Create urgency

## CTA Component Anatomy

### Complete CTA Structure

```
Primary Action (Required):
  "Start free trial"

Value Reinforcement (Required):
  "No credit card required"

Timeframe (Optional):
  "14-day trial"

Secondary Action (Optional):
  "Or watch demo"
```

### Good Example

```
Scene: Final CTA (0-7s within CTA scene)

On-Screen Copy:
  Primary: "Start your free trial"
  Value: "No credit card • 5-minute setup"
  Secondary: "Or schedule a demo"

Visual:
  - Large, clear button: "Start Free Trial"
  - Small text below with friction reducers
  - Smaller "Schedule Demo" link below
  - Product screenshot in background (not logo)

Psychology:
  - Clear primary action (trial)
  - Removes objections (no CC, quick setup)
  - Offers alternative for those not ready (demo)
  - Shows product, not branding

Timing: 7 seconds (adequate time to read and process)
```

### Bad Example

```
On-Screen: "Learn More"

Why it fails:
- Vague action (learn what? where?)
- No value communicated
- No urgency or next step clarity
- Could mean anything (blog post? whitepaper? product tour?)
```

## Action Word Hierarchy

### High-Converting Action Words

**Free/No-Risk Actions** (Highest conversion):
- "Start free trial"
- "Try free for 14 days"
- "Get instant access"
- "Download free"

**Low-Commitment Actions** (High conversion):
- "See how it works"
- "Watch demo"
- "Get pricing"
- "Calculate savings"

**Medium-Commitment Actions** (Medium conversion):
- "Schedule demo"
- "Talk to sales"
- "Request invite"
- "Join waitlist"

**Purchase Actions** (Lower conversion, higher intent):
- "Buy now"
- "Start plan"
- "Subscribe today"
- "Get started" (if paid)

### Words to Avoid

❌ "Learn more" — Too vague
❌ "Submit" — Transactional, cold
❌ "Click here" — Web 1.0, no value
❌ "Sign up" — Feels like work
❌ "Register" — Bureaucratic

## Friction Removal

### Critical Friction Reducers

```
✅ "No credit card required"
✅ "Free forever" (if true)
✅ "Cancel anytime"
✅ "5-minute setup"
✅ "No installation needed"
✅ "Works with tools you use"
✅ "Free for 14 days"
✅ "30-day money-back guarantee"
```

### Friction Reducer Placement

```
Good:
Primary: "Start free trial"
Friction: "No credit card required"

Bad:
Primary: "Sign up"
Friction: [none]
```

## Urgency and Scarcity

### Authentic Urgency

✅ **Use when genuine**:
- "Early access ends Friday"
- "100 spots left in beta"
- "Launch pricing expires in 3 days"
- "Cohort starts next Monday"

❌ **Never use if fake**:
- Fake countdown timers
- False "only 3 left" claims
- Perpetual "limited time" offers

### Good Example (Authentic)

```
CTA Scene:
Primary: "Join the beta"
Urgency: "We're accepting 500 users this month"
Secondary: "Join 1,200 on the waitlist instead"

Psychology:
- Real scarcity (500 spots)
- Alternative offered (waitlist)
- Social proof built in (1,200 waiting)
```

### Bad Example (Dishonest)

```
CTA: "Offer expires in 23:59:47"
[Timer resets for every viewer]

Why it fails:
- Dishonest (viewers know this)
- Damages trust
- Converts wrong customers
```

## Visual CTA Best Practices

### Button/Visual Design

**Good CTA Visual**:
```
Visual Elements:
- Primary CTA button: Large, high contrast, clear text
- Button color: Brand accent or high-visibility color
- Size: ~20% of screen real estate
- Position: Bottom third, centered
- Animation: Subtle pulse or glow
- Supporting text: Below button, smaller
- Background: Product in use (not logo)
```

**Bad CTA Visual**:
```
- Small button or text-only
- Low contrast (white text on light blue)
- Multiple competing CTAs same size
- Logo/branding instead of product
- No animation or draw to CTA
```

### Text Hierarchy

```
Primary Action (Largest):
  "Start Free Trial"

Value Props (Medium):
  "No credit card • 5-min setup"

Secondary Action (Smallest):
  "Or schedule demo"
```

## Multi-CTA Strategy

For complex or high-ticket products:

### Primary/Secondary Pattern

```
Scene: CTA (8s total)

Primary (0-5s):
  "Start free trial"
  Most prominent, for ready buyers

Secondary (5-8s):
  "Or schedule a demo"
  For those needing human touch

Visual:
  Primary button: Large, animated
  Secondary link: Smaller, below

Psychology:
  Accommodate different readiness levels
```

## CTA Reinforcement

Don't just state the CTA — reinforce why they should act:

### Good Example

```
CTA Scene:
"Start your free trial"
"Join 8,000 teams shipping faster"
[Visual: Happy customers using product]

Reinforcement:
  Social proof reminder
  Benefit reminder (shipping faster)
  Shows real people (not just numbers)
```

### Bad Example

```
CTA Scene:
"Start your free trial"
[Visual: Company logo]

Why it fails:
  No reinforcement of value
  Branding instead of benefit
  Nothing to build confidence
```

## CTA Duration

### Minimum Timing Rules

| Video Length | Min CTA Duration | Max CTA Duration |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 15-30s | 3s | 6s |
| 30-60s | 5s | 8s |
| 60-90s | 6s | 10s |
| 90-180s | 7s | 12s |
| 3-10min | 10s | 20s |

**Principle**: Longer videos = more time to process and act on CTA

## Platform-Specific CTAs

### Social Media (In-Feed)

```
CTA:
  "Link in bio"
  OR
  "Swipe up" (Stories)
  OR
  "Click to learn more" (with tracking link)

Visual:
  - Arrow pointing to action
  - Text overlay clear and bold
```

### Landing Page Videos

```
CTA:
  "See pricing below"
  OR
  "Scroll to get started"

Connects video to page elements
```

### Standalone Videos (YouTube, Vimeo)

```
CTA:
  "Visit [URL]"
  OR
  "Link in description"

Include clickable CTA in video description
```

## CTA Voice and Tone

Match CTA tone to brand and audience:

### B2B Professional

```
"Schedule a demo"
"Request pricing"
"Talk to our team"

Tone: Professional, consultative
```

### B2C Casual

```
"Get started free"
"Try it now"
"Join thousands already saving"

Tone: Friendly, action-oriented
```

### Technical/Developer

```
"Start building"
"Fork the repo"
"Read the docs"

Tone: Technical, direct
```

## Testing CTAs

### A/B Test Elements

Test one element at a time:

1. **Action word**: "Start free trial" vs "Get started free"
2. **Friction reducer**: "No CC" vs "Cancel anytime"
3. **Urgency**: With vs without limited offer
4. **Secondary CTA**: With vs without alternative
5. **Visual**: Button vs text link vs both

### Performance Metrics

Track:
- **Click-through rate** (CTR)
- **Conversion rate** (completed action)
- **Completion rate** (started → finished)

## Common CTA Mistakes

### 1. Multiple Primary CTAs

**Bad**:
```
"Start trial" (same size as)
"Schedule demo" (same size as)
"Download whitepaper"
```

Splits attention, reduces conversion on all.

**Good**:
```
Primary: "Start trial" (large)
Secondary: "Or schedule demo" (small)
```

### 2. CTA Too Early

**Bad**:
```
15s video:
  0-5s: Hook
  5-10s: CTA (before showing value)
  10-15s: Product demo
```

**Good**:
```
  0-5s: Hook
  5-12s: Product demo / value
  12-15s: CTA (after value shown)
```

### 3. Weak Action Words

**Bad**: "Learn more", "Click here", "Submit"
**Good**: "Start free trial", "Get instant access", "Try free"

### 4. No Friction Removal

**Bad**: "Sign up now"
**Good**: "Start free trial • No credit card required"

### 5. Dishonest Urgency

**Bad**: Fake countdown timer
**Good**: Real launch deadline or genuine scarcity
