  → Live Q&A sessions

✓ Gradual ramp
  → Don't throw into queue day 1
  → Shadowing before handling
  → Supervised before independent

✓ Assigned mentor
  → Go-to person for questions
  → Regular check-ins
  → Safe space to learn

✓ Early feedback
  → Weekly 1:1s during onboarding
  → QA on all tickets initially
  → Course corrections early
```

### Bad Onboarding Practices

```
✗ Drink from firehose
  → Too much info in week 1
  → Retention is minimal

✗ Sink or swim
  → "Here's the queue, good luck"
  → Mistakes damage customer experience

✗ Tribal knowledge only
  → Learn from whoever's around
  → Inconsistent information

✗ No documentation
  → "Ask Sarah about that"
  → Single points of failure

✗ Same for everyone
  → Experienced hires treated like new grads
  → New grads expected to know basics

✗ Training then forgotten
  → No ongoing development
  → Skills stagnate

### Common Onboarding Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Information overload** | Low retention | Space learning over weeks |
| **No practice time** | Theory only | Include sandbox exercises |
| **Skipping soft skills** | Poor communication | Integrate throughout |
| **Generic training** | Irrelevant content | Role-specific paths |
| **No feedback loop** | Issues persist | Regular check-ins |
| **Ending at week 4** | Knowledge gaps | Ongoing program |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Training as checkbox** — Completed but not learned
- **Firehose approach** — All information in week 1
- **No hands-on practice** — Reading without doing
- **Tribal knowledge only** — "Ask Bob"
- **One-time training** — No ongoing development
- **Ignoring soft skills** — Technical only
- **No assessment** — Assume learning happened
- **Senior agent = trainer** — Good agent ≠ good teacher
