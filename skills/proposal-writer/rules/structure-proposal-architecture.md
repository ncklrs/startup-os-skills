## Proposal Architecture & Components

**Impact: CRITICAL**

The structure of your proposal determines whether it gets read. Buyers are busy; make every section earn its place.

### The Winning Proposal Structure

| Section | Pages | Purpose | Reader |
|---------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Cover Page** | 1 | First impression, personalization | Everyone |
| **Executive Summary** | 1 | Decision snapshot | C-level |
| **Understanding** | 1-2 | Prove you listened | Champion |
| **Solution Overview** | 2-3 | What you propose | Technical buyer |
| **Investment** | 1-2 | Cost & value | Finance, exec |
| **Timeline** | 1 | When they see value | Project owner |
| **Proof Points** | 1-2 | Why trust you | Risk-averse buyer |
| **Next Steps** | 0.5 | Drive action | Decision-maker |

### Section-by-Section Breakdown

**Cover Page Must-Haves:**
```
✓ Client company name (large, prominent)
✓ Proposal title tied to their goal
✓ Date and validity period
✓ Your logo and contact info
✓ Prepared for: [Name, Title]
```

**Understanding Section Formula:**
```
We understand that [company] is focused on [strategic goal].

Currently, [their situation/challenge] is causing [specific pain]:
- [Pain point 1 with quantified impact]
- [Pain point 2 with quantified impact]
- [Pain point 3 with quantified impact]

You've identified that [desired outcome] is critical to [business objective].
```

**Solution Overview Structure:**
```
1. Solution summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Key capabilities aligned to their needs
3. How it works (simplified)
4. What makes this approach effective
5. Expected outcomes
```

### Good Example: Well-Structured Understanding Section

```markdown
## Understanding Your Challenge

TechCorp is scaling rapidly, expecting to grow from 50 to 200 engineers
in the next 18 months. This growth has exposed critical gaps in your
developer onboarding and secrets management processes.

Based on our discovery conversations with Sarah Chen (VP Engineering)
and Marcus Johnson (Security Lead), we understand:

**Current State:**
- New developers take 3+ weeks to become productive
- Secrets are stored inconsistently across 12 different systems
- Two security incidents in the past quarter traced to credential exposure
- Manual rotation processes consume 20+ hours per month

**Desired Outcome:**
- Reduce developer onboarding to under 1 week
- Centralize secrets management with automated rotation
- Achieve SOC 2 compliance before your Series B close in Q3

This proposal outlines how SecretStash can help you achieve these
outcomes within 90 days.
```

### Bad Example: Generic Understanding Section

```markdown
## Company Overview

SecretStash is a leading provider of secrets management solutions.
We help companies of all sizes secure their credentials and API keys.

## Your Needs

You need a secrets management solution that is:
- Secure
- Scalable
- Easy to use
- Cost-effective

SecretStash provides all of these benefits and more.
```

**Why it fails:**
- Talks about vendor, not customer
- Generic needs that apply to anyone
- No proof of listening or discovery
- No specific pain or impact quantified

### Proposal Length Guidelines

| Deal Size | Proposal Type | Ideal Length |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| < $25K ACV | Solution Brief | 3-5 pages |
| $25K-$100K | Standard Proposal | 6-10 pages |
| $100K-$500K | Full Proposal | 10-15 pages |
| > $500K | Comprehensive + Appendix | 15-25 pages |
| RFP Response | Per requirements | Variable |

### Section Prioritization by Buyer Role

| Role | Reads First | Skips | Cares Most About |
|------|-------------|-------|------------------|
| **CEO/CFO** | Exec summary, pricing | Technical details | ROI, risk |
| **VP/Director** | Understanding, solution | Appendix | Outcomes, timeline |
| **Technical Lead** | Solution, approach | Company overview | How it works |
| **Procurement** | Pricing, terms | Solution | Compliance, legal |
| **Champion** | Everything | Nothing | Ammo to sell internally |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Burying the lead** — Important info hidden on page 7
- **Feature-first** — Starting with what you do vs. what they need
- **Missing understanding** — Jumping straight to solution
- **Appendix overload** — 50 pages of irrelevant attachments
- **No page numbers** — Makes discussion impossible
- **Missing table of contents** — For proposals > 5 pages
