## Price Increases and Lifecycle Communication

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Price increases are necessary for healthy businesses but must be handled carefully. Poor execution causes churn, support burden, and brand damage. Good execution strengthens customer relationships.

### When to Raise Prices

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Value increased significantly** | New features, better product |
| **Costs increased** | Infrastructure, support, compliance |
| **Market shifted** | Competitors raised prices |
| **Underpriced at launch** | Validated higher willingness-to-pay |
| **Conversion too high** | 80%+ conversion = priced too low |
| **No resistance** | Prospects never push back on price |
| **Margin compression** | Growth without profit |

### Price Increase Magnitude

| Increase | Perception | Frequency |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **5-10%** | Inflation adjustment | Annual OK |
| **10-20%** | Moderate increase | Every 2-3 years |
| **20-40%** | Significant change | Major product changes |
| **40%+** | Re-pricing | With grandfathering |

### Grandfathering Strategies

| Strategy | Description | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Forever grandfathered** | Old price indefinitely | Loyal, long-term customers |
| **Locked for X years** | Old price for 1-2 years | Standard approach |
| **Graduated increase** | Phased to new price | Large increases |
| **Feature-based** | Old price, old features | Adding new tier |
| **No grandfathering** | Everyone to new price | Rare, small increases |

### Good Grandfathering Approach

```
✓ Tiered transition:
"Your current price: $79/mo
 New price: $129/mo

 Here's your transition:
 • Today - Dec 2025: $79/mo (no change)
 • Jan 2026 - Dec 2026: $99/mo (25% increase)
 • Jan 2027+: $129/mo (new price)

 As a thank you for being an early customer, you'll always
 get priority support regardless of your plan."
```

### Bad Grandfathering Approach

```
✗ No warning:
"Starting immediately, your plan is now $129/mo."
→ Shock, anger, support tickets

✗ Hidden in terms:
"As per section 12.4 of our terms, prices may change..."
→ Technically legal, practically damaging

✗ Patronizing:
"We know price increases are hard, but we're confident
 you'll find the value worth it!"
→ Dismissive of legitimate concerns
```

### Communication Timeline

| Timing | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **60-90 days before** | Announce to existing customers |
| **30 days before** | Reminder email |
| **7 days before** | Final reminder |
| **Day of** | Confirmation of change |
| **After** | Check in, handle issues |

### Good Price Increase Email

```
✓ Subject: "Your Acme plan pricing is changing on March 1"

Lead:
"Starting March 1, 2025, your Pro plan will increase from
 $99/mo to $129/mo."

Why:
"Here's what we've built since you joined:
 • AI-powered analytics (launched January)
 • 99.99% uptime SLA (up from 99.9%)
 • SOC 2 Type II certification
 • 24/7 live chat support

 To continue investing in these improvements, we're

 your current $99/mo pricing through June 1, 2025."

Options:
"If you'd like to lock in $99/mo for another year,
 you can switch to annual billing anytime before March 1."
```

### Bad Price Increase Email

```
✗ Subject: "Exciting news about your account!"
→ Misleading, erodes trust

✗ Lead: "We're thrilled to announce pricing updates!"
→ Tone-deaf, customers aren't thrilled

✗ Why: "Due to market conditions and operational costs..."
→ Vague, no value explanation

✗ No timeline: "Prices will change soon"
→ Creates anxiety, unclear

✗ No options: "Your new price is $X, thanks!"
→ Feels forced, no agency
```

### FAQ for Price Increases

| Question | Good Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| "Why now?" | Specific improvements + honest cost factors |
| "Can I keep old pricing?" | Clear grandfathering terms |
| "What if I can't afford it?" | Downgrade options, annual lock-in |
| "Will prices increase again?" | Honest answer + commitment period |
| "What's changed?" | Concrete feature list |

### Handling Pushback

| Response Type | How to Handle |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Understanding** | Thank them, confirm transition |
| **Questions** | Answer directly, offer call |
| **Frustration** | Acknowledge, restate options |
| **Threats to churn** | Understand needs, offer alternatives |
| **Demands** | Hear out, but hold boundaries |

### Good Pushback Handling

```
Customer: "30% increase is ridiculous. I'm canceling."

Response: "I hear you—a 30% increase is significant, and I
understand if that changes your calculation.

Before you cancel, I want to make sure you know your options:
1. Lock in current pricing for 12 months with annual billing
2. Downgrade to our Starter plan at $X/mo
3. If neither works, I can offer a 3-month extension at
   current pricing while you evaluate alternatives

What matters most to you right now?"
```

### New Price vs Old Price for New Customers

| Approach | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **New price immediately** | Standard—new customers get new price |
| **Promotional window** | "Old price for new signups through [date]" |
| **Tiered rollout** | New price for new signups, then existing |

### Price Decrease Considerations

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **Simplification** | Merge tiers, communicate value |
| **Competitive response** | Position as permanent, not reactive |
| **Market change** | Acknowledge market, emphasize value |
| **Existing customers** | Auto-apply new lower price |

### Metrics to Track During Price Change

| Metric | What to Watch |
|--------|---------------|
| **Churn rate** | Before/during/after comparison |
| **Support tickets** | Volume and sentiment |
| **Downgrade rate** | Movement to lower tiers |
| **Annual conversion** | Lock-in response |
| **NPS/CSAT** | Customer sentiment |
| **New customer conversion** | Price sensitivity at new level |
