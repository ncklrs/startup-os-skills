## Willingness to Pay Research

**Impact: HIGH**

Most companies guess at pricing. Systematic willingness-to-pay (WTP) research reveals what customers will actually pay, reducing risk and capturing more value.

### Why Research WTP

| Approach | Accuracy | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Gut feeling** | Low | High—usually underprices |
| **Cost-plus** | Low | Ignores value, leaves money |
| **Competitor copy** | Medium | May not fit your value |
| **WTP research** | High | Data-driven decisions |

### WTP Research Methods

| Method | Complexity | Best For |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Van Westendorp** | Low | New products, ranges |
| **Gabor-Granger** | Medium | Testing specific prices |
| **Conjoint analysis** | High | Feature/price trade-offs |
| **A/B testing** | Medium | Live price testing |
| **Customer interviews** | Low | Qualitative understanding |

### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

Four questions reveal price range:

```
1. "At what price would you consider this product to be so
    expensive that you would not consider buying it?"
    → Too expensive

2. "At what price would you consider this product to be priced
    so low that you would question its quality?"
    → Too cheap

3. "At what price would you consider this product to be starting
    to get expensive, so that it's not out of the question, but
    you'd have to give some thought to buying it?"
    → Expensive (high side of OK)

4. "At what price would you consider this product to be a
    bargain—a great buy for the money?"
    → Cheap (low side of OK)
```

PMC = Point of Marginal Cheapness
IDP = Indifference Price Point (optimal)
OPP = Optimal Price Point
PME = Point of Marginal Expensiveness

Acceptable Price Range: PMC to PME
```

### Gabor-Granger Method

Test specific price points:

```
"Would you buy this product at $X?"
├── If Yes: "Would you buy at $X+20%?"
│   ├── If Yes: Continue raising
│   └── If No: Record max WTP
└── If No: "Would you buy at $X-20%?"
    ├── If Yes: Record as price-sensitive buyer
    └── If No: Continue lowering or eliminate

Result: Demand curve at tested price points
```

### Customer Interview Questions

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| "How do you currently solve this?" | Alternative costs |
| "What does this problem cost you?" | Value ceiling |
| "What would you pay to make this go away?" | Direct WTP |
| "If this cost $X, would that feel fair?" | Price reaction |
| "What would make $X feel worth it?" | Value drivers |
| "At what price would you walk away?" | Price ceiling |

### Good Interview Approach

```
✓ "Tell me about the last time you had [problem]."
  → Establishes real pain

✓ "How much time did that cost you?"
  → Quantifies value

✓ "If you could make that never happen again,
    what would that be worth to you?"
  → Direct value question

✓ "Some people pay $99/mo for this, others pay $299/mo.
    What makes the difference in your mind?"
  → Reveals value perception

✓ "If this were $149/mo, would you sign up today?"
  → Tests specific price point
```

### Bad Interview Approach

```
✗ "What would you pay for this?"
  → Customers always low-ball

✗ "Is $99/mo too expensive?"
  → Leading question

✗ "Our competitor charges $200, we're only $99."
  → Anchors to competitor, not value

✗ "What features would justify a higher price?"
  → Focus on features, not outcomes
```

### A/B Testing Pricing

| Test Type | Setup | Considerations |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Price test** | Different prices, same product | Need volume, ethics concern |
| **Package test** | Same price, different packages | Cleaner signal |
| **Anchor test** | Different display, same price | Low risk |
| **Conversion test** | Test signup conversion | Doesn't test long-term LTV |

### Pricing A/B Test Ethics

| Practice | Guideline |
|----------|-----------|
| **Equal access** | Don't charge different prices to same audience |
| **Time-based** | Test different periods, not same period |
| **New customers** | Test on new customers, not existing |
| **Small differences** | 10-20% range, not 2x differences |
| **Post-test equity** | Honor lowest price if discovered |

### Segmented WTP Analysis

| Segment | Typical WTP | Research Approach |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Enterprise** | Highest | Sales conversations, RFPs |
| **Mid-market** | High | Mixed interviews + surveys |
| **SMB** | Medium | Large-scale surveys |
| **Prosumer** | Low-Medium | Product analytics |
| **Consumer** | Lowest | A/B testing, surveys |

### WTP by Customer Characteristic

| Factor | Higher WTP | Lower WTP |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Company size** | Enterprise | SMB |
| **Pain severity** | Acute problem | Nice-to-have |
| **Sophistication** | Early adopter | Laggard |
| **Budget ownership** | Has budget | Needs approval |
| **Alternative cost** | High | Low/free options |
| **Switching cost** | Already invested | Fresh evaluation |

### Value-Based Pricing Calculation

```
Step 1: Quantify the value delivered
├── Time saved: 5 hours/week × $75/hour = $375/week = $1,625/mo
├── Revenue impact: 2% conversion lift × $100K/mo = $2,000/mo
└── Risk avoided: $10K breach × 5% risk = $500/mo

Step 2: Total value = $4,125/mo

Step 3: Price at 10-30% of value
├── Conservative (10%): $412/mo
├── Standard (20%): $825/mo
└── Aggressive (30%): $1,237/mo

Step 4: Validate with research
```

### Sample Size Guidelines

| Method | Minimum Sample | Ideal Sample |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Van Westendorp** | 50 | 200+ |
| **Gabor-Granger** | 100 | 300+ |
| **Conjoint** | 200 | 500+ |
| **Interviews** | 10-15 | 30+ |
| **A/B test** | Depends on conversion | 95% confidence |

### Research to Action

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **WTP higher than current** | Raise prices |
| **WTP lower than current** | Add value or find new segment |
| **Wide WTP range** | Segment with tiers |
| **Tight WTP cluster** | Flat pricing may work |
| **Strong feature preferences** | Reconsider packaging |

### Common WTP Research Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Asking hypothetical questions | Get hypothetical answers |
| Leading with price | Anchors and biases responses |
| Wrong audience | Research existing, price for new |
| Too few respondents | Noise, not signal |
| Ignoring segments | Blended data hides segments |
| Research once, never again | Markets change |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Skipping research** — Guessing leaves money on table
- **Asking "What would you pay?"** — Customers lie low
- **Single method only** — Triangulate with multiple methods
- **Research on existing customers only** — Selection bias
- **Ignoring qualitative** — Numbers without context
- **Over-engineering** — Simple research beats no research
- **Analysis paralysis** — Research to inform, not to avoid decision
- **Set it and forget it** — WTP changes over time
