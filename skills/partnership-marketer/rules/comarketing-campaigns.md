## Co-Marketing Campaigns

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Co-marketing multiplies reach when done right. It fails when partners have misaligned expectations or unclear ownership.

### Co-Marketing Campaign Types

| Campaign Type | Investment | Best For | Expected Results |
|---------------|------------|----------|------------------|
| **Joint Webinar** | Medium | Thought leadership, lead gen | 200-1000 registrants |
| **Co-branded Content** | Low-Medium | SEO, lead nurture | Evergreen asset |
| **Email Swap** | Low | List expansion | 2-5% CTR |
| **Social Amplification** | Low | Awareness | 2x reach |
| **Joint Case Study** | Medium | Sales enablement | Trust building |
| **Co-sponsored Event** | High | Pipeline, relationships | Direct meetings |
| **Bundle/Offer** | Medium-High | Acquisition, upsell | Revenue impact |

### Co-Branding Guidelines

| Element | Approach | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Logo placement** | Equal prominence | Both logos same size, your logo left |
| **Color scheme** | Primary brand owns | Use your brand colors with partner accent |
| **Tone of voice** | Neutral or primary | "Acme and PartnerCo present..." |
| **Call-to-action** | Lead brand owns | Your CTA, your landing page |
| **Legal/Disclaimer** | Both required | Both company names in copyright |

### Lead Distribution Models

| Model | When to Use | Process |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Lead Share** | Equal contribution | Both get all leads |
| **Primary/Secondary** | Unequal contribution | Primary gets first contact |
| **Round Robin** | Testing territory | Alternate lead assignment |
| **Qualification First** | High value content | Sales qualify, then route |
| **Self-Selection** | Product-specific interest | Lead chooses at registration |

### Good Co-Marketing Campaign

```
✓ Clear objective and success metrics upfront
  → "Generate 500 MQLs from HR decision-makers
      through joint webinar series"

✓ Documented responsibilities
  → We: Content, landing page, speaker
  → Partner: Email to 50K list, social amplification
  → Both: Follow-up within 24 hours

✓ Agreed lead handling
  → All registrants shared
  → Attendees marked hot, get same-day follow-up
  → No-shows enter joint nurture sequence

✓ Post-campaign review
  → 623 registrants (exceeded goal)
  → 41% attendance rate
  → 23 SQLs generated
  → Next webinar planned for Q2

✓ Content repurposing plan
  → Recording → YouTube, blog embed
  → Slides → LinkedIn carousel
  → Key quotes → Social snippets
  → Q&A → FAQ blog post
```

### Bad Co-Marketing Campaign

```
✗ Vague objectives
  → "Let's do something together"
  → No target audience, no metrics
  → Campaign drifts, results unclear

✗ Imbalanced effort
  → You create all content
  → Partner sends one tweet
  → 90% of leads from your promotion

✗ No lead agreement
  → Both companies call same lead
  → Lead annoyed, complains
  → Partnership tension

✗ Mismatched audiences
  → Your ICP: Series A startups
  → Partner's list: Enterprise Fortune 500
  → Content resonates with neither

✗ No follow-through
  → Great webinar, 400 attendees
  → Leads never followed up
  → No attribution to revenue
```

|------|----------|-------|

### Budget Allocation

| Campaign Type | Your Investment | Partner Investment |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Joint Webinar** | $2-5K (platform, promotion) | $2-5K (promotion) |
| **Co-branded eBook** | $5-10K (content, design) | $3-5K (promotion) |
| **Event Sponsorship** | 50% of sponsorship | 50% of sponsorship |
| **Paid Amplification** | Split based on audience share | Proportional |

### Promotion Channel Mix

| Channel | Your Role | Partner Role |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Email** | Your list, 3 sends | Their list, 3 sends |
| **LinkedIn** | Company + team posts | Company + team posts |
| **Twitter/X** | 5-7 posts over 2 weeks | 5-7 posts |
| **In-app** | Banner, notification | Banner, notification |
| **Blog** | Announcement post | Announcement post |
| **Paid** | Retargeting, LinkedIn | Retargeting |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Unclear ownership** — When everyone's responsible, no one is
- **Last-minute planning** — Quality suffers, promotion insufficient
- **Siloed metrics** — Can't prove ROI, partnership undervalued
- **One-and-done** — Single campaigns don't build momentum
- **Over-designed content** — Approval cycles kill timeliness
- **Ignoring post-campaign** — The follow-up matters more than the event
- **Asymmetric effort** — Breeds resentment, kills future collaboration
