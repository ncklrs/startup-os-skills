1. Be respectful and inclusive
2. Stay on topic
3. No spam or self-promotion

5. Use appropriate channels
6. No sharing of credentials/keys

**Enforcement ladder:**
1. Friendly reminder
2. Official warning
3. Temporary mute (24h)
4. Longer suspension (7d)
5. Permanent ban

### Developer Advocacy vs Support

| Developer Advocacy | Developer Support |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Proactive engagement | Reactive help |
| Content creation | Ticket resolution |
| Community building | Individual issues |
| External-facing | Internal-facing |
| Scales through content | Scales through tooling |
| Measured by reach | Measured by resolution |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Ghost town** — Community exists but no team engagement
- **Corporate speak** — Marketing language in developer spaces
- **Ignoring criticism** — Deleting negative feedback
- **Overpromising** — Committing to features without PM alignment
- **Champion neglect** — Not nurturing top contributors
- **Metrics obsession** — Optimizing vanity metrics over health
- **One-way broadcast** — Announcing without engaging
- **Slow responses** — Letting questions go unanswered
- **No escalation path** — Community can't reach decision-makers
