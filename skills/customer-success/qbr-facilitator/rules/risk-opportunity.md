## Risk & Opportunity Identification

**Impact: HIGH**

The QBR is both a diagnostic tool and a treatment opportunity. A skilled CSM uses the QBR to surface hidden risks before they become churn and uncover expansion opportunities before competitors do. The best QBRs save accounts and grow them.

### Risk Categories

| Category | Signals | QBR Discovery Questions |
|----------|---------|-------------------------|
| **Adoption** | Low usage, declining engagement | "How is the team finding the platform?" |
| **Champion** | Contact leaving, disengaged | "Any changes on your team?" |
| **Technical** | Integration issues, performance | "How's the technical experience?" |
| **Value** | ROI unclear, outcomes not met | "Are you seeing the value you expected?" |
| **Competitive** | Evaluating alternatives | "How does this compare to other tools?" |
| **Budget** | Cost concerns, scrutiny | "How is budget looking for next year?" |
| **Strategic** | Priority shift, reorg | "Any changes in company direction?" |
| **Relationship** | Strained communications | Direct observation, tone |

### Risk Identification Framework

```
## CHURN Risk Assessment

C - CHAMPION
    □ Champion engaged and present?
    □ Champion's organizational standing?
    □ Backup relationships established?

H - HEALTH
    □ Health score trending up/down?
    □ Adoption metrics healthy?
    □ Support experience positive?

U - UTILIZATION
    □ Users active at expected level?
    □ Core features being used?
    □ Value being extracted?

R - RELATIONSHIP
    □ Regular engagement maintained?
    □ Sentiment positive?
    □ Communication responsive?

N - NEED
    □ Still solving original problem?
    □ Business priorities aligned?
    □ Use case still relevant?
```

### Good Risk Discovery

```
✓ Proactive inquiry
  → Ask about potential issues before they surface
  → "What concerns do you have going forward?"
  → Create space for honest feedback

✓ Pattern recognition
  → Connect signals from data + conversation
  → Declining usage + vague responses = risk
  → Look for inconsistencies

✓ Safe space for honesty
  → "I'd rather hear the hard truth now..."
  → Don't get defensive
  → Thank them for candor

✓ Direct but diplomatic
  → "I noticed engagement has declined..."
  → Name what you see
  → Invite explanation

✓ Action-oriented response
  → Every risk needs a mitigation plan
  → "Here's what we'll do about that..."
  → Follow through visibly
```

### Bad Risk Discovery

```
✗ Avoiding difficult topics
  → Pretending everything is fine
  → Skipping past declining metrics
  → Not asking about challenges

✗ Defensive reactions
  → "That's not our fault"
  → "Other customers love that feature"
  → Dismissing concerns

✗ Surprise reactions
  → Shocked by issues you should have seen
  → Not monitoring account health
  → Reactive, not proactive

✗ All talk, no action
  → Acknowledge risks, do nothing
  → Same issues QBR after QBR
  → Erodes trust completely

✗ Escalation avoidance
  → Hiding risks from leadership
  → Hoping problems resolve
  → Missing intervention window
```

### Risk Signal Checklist

```
□ Pre-QBR Signals
  □ Usage trending down
  □ Key users inactive
  □ Support tickets increasing
  □ Response times slowing
  □ NPS/CSAT declining
  □ Contract coming up without expansion conversation

□ During-QBR Signals
  □ Executive not present (when usually are)
  □ Vague or evasive answers
  □ Short meeting, quick to end
  □ Discussing competitors
  □ Budget/cost concerns raised
  □ Champion seems disengaged
  □ New stakeholders questioning value
  □ Asking about cancellation/downgrade

□ Post-QBR Signals
  □ No response to follow-up
  □ Actions not completed
  □ Next QBR postponed/cancelled
  □ Contact goes silent
```

### Risk Discovery Questions

| Risk Area | Discovery Question | What to Listen For |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Value** | "How would you rate the ROI so far?" | Hesitation, qualifiers |
| **Adoption** | "How broadly is the team using us?" | Limited scope, "some people" |
| **Competition** | "Are you looking at any other solutions?" | Yes, or evasive non-answer |
| **Budget** | "How are you thinking about this investment going forward?" | Cost focus, scrutiny |
| **Champion** | "Any changes on your team we should know about?" | Departures, reorgs |
| **Priority** | "Where does this fit in your priorities?" | Declining importance |
| **Satisfaction** | "On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you?" | Below 8 is a warning |

### Opportunity Categories

| Category | Signals | QBR Discovery Approach |
|----------|---------|------------------------|
| **User expansion** | High adoption, requests for more seats | "Who else could benefit?" |
| **Use case expansion** | Asking about new capabilities | "What other problems could we solve?" |
| **Product upsell** | Using adjacent features, asking about add-ons | "Have you explored [module]?" |
| **Geographic expansion** | Growing into new regions | "How is your global footprint evolving?" |
| **Departmental expansion** | Other teams expressing interest | "Which other teams might benefit?" |
| **Advocacy** | High satisfaction, strong champion | "Would you share your experience?" |

### Opportunity Discovery Questions

```
## Expansion-Focused Questions

USER GROWTH
- "Are there teams we're not reaching yet?"
- "How many people could theoretically use this?"
- "What's blocking broader adoption?"

USE CASE EXPANSION
- "What's the next problem you're trying to solve?"
- "Are there adjacent workflows we should discuss?"
- "What would make this 2x more valuable?"

PRODUCT EXPANSION
- "Have you explored our [other product/module]?"
- "Would [capability] help with your goals?"
- "What's on your wish list?"

STRATEGIC GROWTH
- "How is the company growing this year?"
- "Any new initiatives that might need this?"
- "What does success look like in 3 years?"
```

### Risk Escalation Matrix

| Risk Level | Criteria | Escalation | Response Time |
|------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Imminent churn, >$100K ARR | VP + Exec sponsor | Same day |
| **High** | Likely churn, >$50K ARR | Director + Manager | 24 hours |
| **Medium** | Possible churn, significant account | Manager | 1 week |
| **Low** | Early signals, small account | CSM monitors | Next QBR |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Risk avoidance** — Not asking hard questions
- **Defensive response** — Dismissing customer concerns
- **Signal ignorance** — Missing obvious warning signs
- **Escalation fear** — Hiding risks from leadership
- **Opportunity blindness** — Only seeing problems, not growth
- **Passive discovery** — Waiting for customer to raise issues
- **Action gap** — Identifying risks without mitigation plans
- **Single-threaded view** — Only talking to champion about risks
