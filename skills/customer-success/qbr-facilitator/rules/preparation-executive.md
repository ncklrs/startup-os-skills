## Executive Preparation

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Preparation is 80% of QBR success. Walking into an executive meeting without thorough preparation is disrespectful of their time and destructive to your credibility. The best CSMs spend 4-6 hours preparing for a strategic QBR.

Subject: Preparing for Our [Q#] Business Review - Your Input Requested

Hi [Champion],

I'm preparing for our upcoming Quarterly Business Review on [Date]
and want to ensure we cover what matters most to you and your team.

Could you take 5 minutes to share:

1. **Top priorities for next quarter**
   What are the 2-3 most important initiatives for your team?

2. **Successes to highlight**
   What wins would you like to showcase to leadership?

3. **Challenges to address**
   Any obstacles or concerns we should discuss?

4. **Questions for us**
   Topics you'd like us to cover or questions for our team?

5. **Attendee updates**
   Any changes to who should attend?

Your input helps us create a more valuable discussion focused on
your priorities, not just our metrics.

I'll also schedule a 15-minute pre-QBR call next week to align on
the agenda. Please suggest a few times that work.

Thanks,
[CSM Name]
```
