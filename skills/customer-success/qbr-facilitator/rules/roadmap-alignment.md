## Roadmap Alignment

**Impact: HIGH**

Roadmap discussions are one of the most anticipated — and potentially dangerous — parts of a QBR. Done well, they build confidence in the partnership. Done poorly, they create unrealistic expectations or signal you don't understand the customer's needs. Navigate with care.

### Roadmap Discussion Rules

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Share directional roadmap | Commit to specific dates |
| Connect features to their problems | Present full roadmap |
| Set realistic expectations | Overpromise to please |
| Capture feedback for product | Commit to building requests |
| Acknowledge competitive gaps | Bash competitors |
| Celebrate recent releases | Apologize for past delays |

### Good Roadmap Conversations

```
✓ Customer-problem-first
  → "Tell me about the challenge you're facing..."
  → THEN connect to roadmap
  → Not: "Here's everything we're building"

✓ Selective sharing
  → Features relevant to THIS customer
  → Not every item in development
  → Curated, not comprehensive

✓ Appropriate caveats
  → "This is our current direction..."
  → "Timing is always subject to change..."
  → Set expectations clearly

✓ Two-way dialogue
  → "Would this address your need?"
  → "How would you prioritize X vs Y?"
  → Gather input, don't just broadcast

✓ Feedback capture
  → Document requests carefully
  → Close the loop on what you'll do
  → "I'll bring this to our product team"

✓ Celebrate wins
  → "Remember when you asked for X? It's shipping next month"
  → Show responsiveness
  → Build confidence in partnership
```

### Bad Roadmap Conversations

```
✗ Date commitments
  → "That will ship in March"
  → Dates slip, trust erodes
  → Never commit dates you don't control

✗ Full roadmap dump
  → "Here's our entire 12-month roadmap"
  → Overwhelming, irrelevant noise
  → Customer forgets what matters

✗ Promise-to-please
  → "We'll definitely build that for you"
  → Can't commit without product buy-in
  → Broken promises destroy trust

✗ Competitive bashing
  → "Competitor X will never have that"
  → Unprofessional, often wrong
  → Focus on your value, not their flaws

✗ Ignoring requests
  → Customer: "We really need X"
  → CSM: "Let me tell you about Y"
  → Dismissive, tone-deaf

✗ No follow-through
  → Capture requests, never route them
  → Customer feels ignored
  → Same request every QBR
```

### Roadmap Presentation Template

```
## Product Roadmap Update - [Customer Name] QBR

### Recently Shipped (Last 90 Days)
| Feature | Description | Relevance to [Customer] |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| [Feature 1] | [Brief description] | [How it helps them] |
| [Feature 2] | [Brief description] | [How it helps them] |

### Coming Soon (Next Quarter)
| Capability | Problem Solved | Expected Timing |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| [Capability 1] | [Problem] | Q[X] |
| [Capability 2] | [Problem] | Q[X] |

Note: Timing is our current plan and subject to change.

### On the Horizon (Next 2-3 Quarters)
| Direction | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Direction 1] | We're investing in [area] to enable [outcome] |
| [Direction 2] | Exploring [capability] based on customer feedback |

Note: These are directional; specifics TBD.

### Your Feedback in Action
| Your Request | Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| [Request 1] | In development | Targeting Q[X] |
| [Request 2] | Planned | On roadmap for H[X] |
| [Request 3] | Under evaluation | Need more input |

### Discussion Questions
1. Which upcoming capabilities are most relevant to you?
2. What problems are we not addressing that we should?
3. How can we better prioritize your needs?
```

### Feature Request Handling

| Request Type | Response | Follow-up |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **On roadmap** | "Great news — this is planned for [timeframe]" | Share details, offer beta |
| **Under consideration** | "We're evaluating this. Help me understand the use case better..." | Capture detailed requirements |
| **Not planned** | "This isn't currently on our roadmap. Tell me more about why it's important..." | Document for product review |
| **Competitive gap** | "I understand competitor X has this. Here's how we approach this differently..." | Document, don't dismiss |
| **Already exists** | "Actually, you can do this today! Let me show you..." | Schedule enablement |

### Feature Request Documentation

```
## Feature Request Form

### Request Details
- Customer: [Name]
- ARR: $XXX,XXX
- Requestor: [Name, Title]
- Date: [Date]
- CSM: [Name]

### The Request
**What:** [Specific feature/capability requested]

**Why:** [Business problem they're trying to solve]

**Impact:**
- Business impact if built: [Expected outcome]
- Impact if NOT built: [Risk to account]

### Context
- How urgent: [Critical / High / Medium / Low]
- Workaround exists: [Yes/No - describe]
- Other customers requesting: [Yes/No - list]
- Competitive pressure: [Yes/No - which competitor]

### Customer Quote
"[Exact words from customer about why this matters]"

### CSM Recommendation
[Your assessment of validity and priority]
```

### Beta Program Positioning

```
## Offering Beta Access in QBRs

WHEN TO OFFER
✓ Customer expressed need for upcoming feature
✓ Customer is technically capable
✓ Customer has provided valuable feedback before
✓ Strategic account worth extra engagement

HOW TO POSITION
"Based on what you've shared, our [upcoming feature]
could be exactly what you need. We're launching a beta
program in [timeframe], and I'd love to nominate you
for early access. Would you be interested?

This would mean:
- Early access to the capability
- Direct influence on how we build it
- Some extra time providing feedback

What do you think?"

BETA EXPECTATIONS TO SET
- Feature may have rough edges
- Feedback commitment expected
- Timeline may shift
- Support process may differ
```

### Roadmap Timing Language

| Certainty Level | Language to Use | Example |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Committed** | "Shipping in [month]" | Features in active release |
| **Planned** | "Targeting [quarter]" | Committed but not dated |
| **Roadmapped** | "On our roadmap for [half]" | Planned but flexible |
| **Exploring** | "We're exploring / investigating" | Under consideration |
| **Not planned** | "Not on our current roadmap" | Honest about gaps |

### Handling Competitive Questions

```
## When Customer Asks About Competitor Features

DON'T:
- Dismiss the competitor
- Make promises to match
- Get defensive
- Speak negatively about competitor

DO:
- Acknowledge the question professionally
- Understand the underlying need
- Explain your approach/philosophy
- Be honest about gaps
- Focus on your strengths

EXAMPLE RESPONSE:
"I'm familiar with [competitor]'s approach to [feature].
Help me understand — what specific problem would that
solve for you?

[Listen and understand]

Here's how we think about this differently...
[Explain your philosophy]

We [have/don't have] something similar.
[If not: Here's what's on our radar and here's what
we'd need to understand better to prioritize it.]"
```

### Roadmap Governance

| Stakeholder | What They Can Share | What They Cannot Share |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **CSM** | Recently shipped, coming soon, directions | Specific dates, unannounced features |
| **CS Leader** | Strategic direction, major investments | Confidential partnerships |
| **Product** | Detailed roadmap, technical details | Competitive responses, M&A |
| **Executive** | Long-term vision, strategic bets | Board-level discussions |

### Product-CS Feedback Loop

```
## Roadmap Alignment Process

QBR PREPARATION
CSM reviews roadmap → Identifies relevant items → Prepares slides

QBR EXECUTION
Present roadmap → Capture feedback → Document requests

POST-QBR
Submit feature requests → Route to product → Update tracking

QUARTERLY SYNC
Product + CS review → Prioritize requests → Update CSMs

CLOSE THE LOOP
CSM informs customer → Updates status in QBR → Builds trust
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Date promising** — Committing to dates you don't control
- **Roadmap dumping** — Sharing everything, relevant or not
- **Promise-to-please** — Agreeing to build whatever they ask
- **Request ignoring** — Capturing feedback that goes nowhere
- **Competitive bashing** — Speaking negatively about rivals
- **Overselling unbuilt features** — Selling vaporware
- **No feedback loop** — Requests never reach product
- **Static roadmap slides** — Same slides every quarter
