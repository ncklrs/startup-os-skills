## Customer Journey Mapping

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

The customer journey is every interaction a customer has with your company — from first awareness to loyal advocacy. Mapping this journey reveals friction points, gaps, and opportunities to create differentiated experiences.

### The Customer Journey Framework

### Moments of Truth

**Moments of Truth** are critical interactions that disproportionately impact customer perception and loyalty.

| Moment | Stage | Impact | How to Win |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| **First login** | Onboarding | Sets tone for relationship | Instant value, guided experience |
| **First support ticket** | Adoption | Trust builder or destroyer | Fast, empathetic resolution |
| **First QBR** | Adoption | Establishes partnership | Value-focused, not feature-focused |
| **Escalation handling** | Any | Loyalty test | Own it, resolve it, follow up |
| **Renewal conversation** | Renewal | Retention moment | Value demonstration, no surprises |
| **Expansion proposal** | Expansion | Growth moment | Tied to customer success |

### Journey Friction Analysis

| Stage | Common Friction | Impact | Solution |
|-------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| **Onboarding** | Slow access provisioning | Delays time to value | Automated provisioning |
| **Onboarding** | Generic training | Low adoption | Role-based content |
| **Adoption** | No clear next steps | Stalled usage | In-app guidance |
| **Support** | Slow response time | Frustration | SLA guarantees |
| **Renewal** | Late engagement | Surprise churn | 90-day playbook |
| **Expansion** | No clear path | Missed revenue | Usage-based triggers |

### Good Journey Design

```
✓ Proactive communication
  → Customer knows what's next
  → No surprises

✓ Seamless handoffs
  → No repeated questions
  → Context transfers with customer

✓ Right channel, right time
  → Email for async, call for complex
  → In-app for contextual

✓ Consistent experience
  → Every CSM follows same playbook
  → Customer tier drives experience

✓ Feedback loops
  → Capture experience at each stage
  → Act on insights

✓ Continuous improvement
  → Journey map reviewed quarterly
  → Friction points addressed
```

### Bad Journey Design

```
✗ Reactive touchpoints
  → Only contact when customer reaches out
  → No proactive value

✗ Broken handoffs
  → "Who's your CSM?" at month 3
  → Customer has to re-explain everything

✗ One-size-fits-all
  → Enterprise gets same journey as SMB
  → Inappropriate for complexity

✗ Channel mismatch
  → Complex issues over email
  → Simple questions require calls

✗ No journey ownership
  → "That's sales' job" / "That's support's job"
  → Customer falls through cracks

✗ Static journey
  → Designed once, never updated
  → Doesn't reflect reality
```

### Journey Metrics

| Stage | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Onboarding** | Time to first value | <14 days |
| **Onboarding** | Onboarding completion | >85% |
| **Adoption** | Feature adoption rate | >60% |
| **Adoption** | Health score | >70 |
| **Renewal** | Early renewal rate | >30% |
| **Renewal** | Gross retention | >90% |
| **Expansion** | Net revenue retention | >110% |
| **Advocacy** | Reference customers | 10% of base |

### Cross-Functional Journey Ownership

| Stage | Primary Owner | Secondary Owner |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Awareness** | Marketing | Sales |
| **Evaluation** | Sales | Marketing |
| **Purchase** | Sales | Finance |
| **Onboarding** | CS | Professional Services |
| **Adoption** | CS | Product |
| **Support** | Support | CS |
| **Renewal** | CS | Sales |
| **Expansion** | CS | Sales |
| **Advocacy** | CS | Marketing |

### Journey Mapping Workshop

**Participants:** CS, Sales, Marketing, Product, Support
**Duration:** Half-day
**Output:** Journey map with prioritized improvements

```
AGENDA:

1. CURRENT STATE (90 min)
   → Walk through each stage
   → Document touchpoints
   → Identify emotions
   → Note friction points

2. BREAK (15 min)

3. PRIORITIZATION (60 min)
   → Impact vs effort matrix
   → Quick wins identified

```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Siloed stages** — No one owns the full journey
- **No customer input** — Journey designed without customer feedback
- **One-time exercise** — Journey map created and forgotten
- **Over-engineering** — 50 touchpoints per stage, impossible to execute
- **No metrics** — Can't measure if journey is working
- **Ignoring digital journey** — Only mapping human touchpoints
- **Same journey for all** — Not segment-appropriate
- **Handoff amnesia** — Context lost at every transition
