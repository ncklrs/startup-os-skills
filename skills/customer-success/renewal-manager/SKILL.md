# Renewal Manager

Strategic renewal management expertise for Customer Success teams — from forecasting and pipeline management to negotiation tactics, expansion attachment, and competitive defense.

## Philosophy

Renewals are not administrative events — they are **strategic growth moments**. The renewal is when you convert proven value into predictable revenue and expanded partnerships.

The best renewal managers:
1. **Start early, finish early** — Renewal conversations begin at onboarding
2. **Prove value continuously** — Don't scramble to demonstrate ROI at renewal
3. **Expand before you renew** — Make expansion the natural path
4. **Defend proactively** — Know competitive threats before they surface
5. **Make renewal the easy choice** — Remove friction, maximize value

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `forecasting-*` — Pipeline management, renewal forecasting, revenue prediction
- `playbooks-*` — Segment-specific renewal motions and timelines
- `early-renewal-*` — Early renewal strategies and incentives
- `multiyear-*` — Multi-year deal structuring and benefits
- `pricing-*` — Renewal pricing, packaging, and discount strategies
- `risk-*` — Churn risk mitigation and save plays
- `competitive-*` — Competitive displacement defense
- `negotiation-*` — Contract negotiation for renewals
- `expansion-*` — Expansion attached to renewal
- `operations-*` — Renewal automation and efficiency

## Core Frameworks

### The Renewal Timeline

```
ONBOARDING → ADOPTION → VALUE REALIZATION → PRE-RENEWAL → RENEWAL → POST-RENEWAL
     ↓            ↓              ↓                ↓            ↓           ↓
  Plant seeds  Build case    Prove ROI      Negotiate     Close      Expand
  for renewal  for growth    quantifiably    terms        deal       further
```

### Renewal Health Indicators

| Indicator | Healthy | At Risk | Critical |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Product Usage** | Growing or stable | Declining | Minimal/none |
| **Stakeholder Engagement** | Multiple active | Single thread | Champion gone |
| **Value Realization** | ROI documented | Unclear value | No outcomes |
| **Support Sentiment** | Positive NPS | Neutral | Detractors |
| **Expansion History** | Has expanded | Flat | Contracted |
| **Competitive Activity** | No signals | Evaluating | Active RFP |

### Renewal Timing by Segment

| Segment | First Touch | Active Negotiation | Close Target |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Enterprise** | 180 days out | 120 days out | 60 days out |
| **Mid-Market** | 120 days out | 90 days out | 45 days out |
| **SMB** | 90 days out | 60 days out | 30 days out |
| **Self-Serve** | 60 days out | 30 days out | 14 days out |

### The Renewal Equation

```
        Starting ARR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn
GRR = ────────────────────────────────────────────────── × 100
                      Starting ARR

        Starting ARR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn
NRR = ────────────────────────────────────────────────── × 100
                      Starting ARR

Target Metrics:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Segment      │  GRR Target  │  NRR Target        │
├───────────────┼──────────────┼────────────────────┤
│  Enterprise   │  95%+        │  115-130%          │
│  Mid-Market   │  90%+        │  105-115%          │
│  SMB          │  85%+        │  100-105%          │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Renewal Outcome Categories

| Outcome | Definition | Impact |
|---------|------------|--------|
| **Full Renewal + Expansion** | Renews and grows | NRR boost, ideal |
| **Full Renewal (Flat)** | Renews at same value | GRR maintained |
| **Renewal with Contraction** | Renews at lower value | Revenue loss |
| **Early Renewal** | Renews before term end | Lock-in, less risk |
| **Multi-Year Renewal** | 2-3 year commitment | Predictability |
| **Churn - Voluntary** | Customer chooses to leave | Lost revenue |
| **Churn - Involuntary** | Failed payment, closure | Lost revenue |

### Renewal Risk Categories

| Risk Level | Indicators | Action |
|------------|------------|--------|
| **Green (Healthy)** | High usage, expanding, advocate | Standard renewal motion |
| **Yellow (Monitor)** | Flat usage, single thread, neutral | Increase touchpoints |
| **Orange (At Risk)** | Declining metrics, concerns raised | Risk mitigation playbook |
| **Red (Critical)** | Churn signals, competitor activity | Executive save play |

## Renewal Playbook by Risk Level

| Risk | 180 Days | 120 Days | 90 Days | 60 Days | 30 Days |
|------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Green** | Health check | Value review | Quote sent | Negotiate | Close |
| **Yellow** | Value reinforce | Exec engagement | Save plan | Intensive | Escalate |
| **Red** | Exec escalation | Save play | Go/no-go | Last effort | Accept/fight |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Renewal as afterthought** — Starting conversations 30 days before expiry
- **Price-only negotiation** — Missing value reinforcement, expansion opportunity
- **Single-threaded renewals** — Only talking to one contact
- **Ignoring early signals** — Not acting on declining health scores
- **Discount first mentality** — Leading with price reduction
- **No competitive intelligence** — Surprised by displacement
- **Manual everything** — No automation for scaled renewals
- **Missing expansion window** — Renewing flat when growth was possible
- **Letting contracts lapse** — Auto-renewals without engagement
- **No multi-year strategy** — Year-to-year mindset limits predictability
