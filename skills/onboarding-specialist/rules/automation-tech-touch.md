## Onboarding Automation & Tech-Touch

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Not every customer needs high-touch onboarding. Automation and tech-touch programs can deliver excellent onboarding at scale, often achieving equal or better outcomes than manual programs for appropriate segments. The key is matching touch model to customer needs.

### The Touch Model Spectrum

### Good Tech-Touch Practices

```
✓ Behavior-based triggers
  → Actions drive communications
  → Not just time-based
  → Relevant, not spam

✓ In-app + email coordination
  → In-app for contextual help
  → Email for re-engagement
  → Consistent messaging

✓ Easy human escalation
  → "Need help?" always visible
  → Chat, email, call options
  → Warm handoff when needed

✓ Progressive disclosure
  → Start simple
  → Unlock complexity over time
  → Don't overwhelm day 1

✓ Self-service resources
  → Comprehensive help center
  → Video tutorials
  → Community forums
```

### Bad Tech-Touch Practices

```
✗ Email blast approach
  → Same emails to everyone
  → Ignore behavior signals
  → High unsubscribe rate

✗ No human fallback
  → "Figure it out yourself"
  → Frustrated users churn
  → No escalation path

✗ Overwhelming automation
  → 5 emails per day
  → Constant in-app pop-ups
  → User dismisses everything

✗ Set and forget
  → Build once, never optimize
  → Stale content
  → Poor conversion over time

✗ Generic content
  → "Dear User"
  → No personalization
  → Feels impersonal
```
