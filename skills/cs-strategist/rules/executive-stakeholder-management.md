## Executive Stakeholder Management

**Impact: HIGH**

Deals are won and lost at the executive level. The same is true for renewals and expansions. If your only relationship is with an end user, you're one champion departure away from churn. Executive relationships are insurance, expansion fuel, and competitive moats.

### The Multi-Threading Imperative

```
SINGLE-THREADED (RISKY)
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your Company                       │
│       │                             │
│      CSM                            │
│       │                             │
│       ▼                             │
│   Champion ────────────────┐        │
│                            │        │
│  Customer Company          │        │
└────────────────────────────┼────────┘
                             │
                   Champion leaves = Churn risk

MULTI-THREADED (RESILIENT)
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your Company                       │
│    │     │      │                   │
│   CSM   AE     Exec Sponsor         │
│    │     │      │                   │
│    ▼     ▼      ▼                   │
│  User  Manager  VP/C-level          │
│                            │        │
│  Customer Company          │        │
└────────────────────────────┼────────┘
                             │
              Any single loss = Continuity
```

#### EBR vs QBR

|---------|-----|-----|
| **Audience** | Working-level | Executive-level |
| **Frequency** | Quarterly | Semi-annual/Annual |
| **Duration** | 45-60 min | 60-90 min |
| **Focus** | Operational | Strategic |
| **Content** | Usage, adoption, tactics | Business outcomes, ROI, strategy |
| **Your attendees** | CSM, Manager | CSM, CS Leader, Exec Sponsor |
| **Their attendees** | Champion, Manager | VP/C-level, Champion |

### Champion Development

#### Identifying Potential Champions

| Trait | Indicator | Assessment Method |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Enthusiasm** | Proactively shares wins | Observation, NPS |
| **Influence** | Others listen to them | Org chart, references |
| **Access** | Connected to decision-makers | Stakeholder mapping |
| **Success** | Achieved outcomes with you | Success metrics |
| **Advocacy** | Willing to speak publicly | Direct ask |

#### Champion Enablement

```
INTERNAL CHAMPION ENABLEMENT:
→ Arm with success metrics they can share
→ Provide executive-ready materials
→ Help them build internal business cases
→ Give them "insider" roadmap access
→ Make them look good to their leadership

EXTERNAL CHAMPION ENABLEMENT:
→ Reference customer opportunities
→ Speaking engagements
→ Case study participation
→ Advisory board membership
→ Exclusive events access
```

### Executive Sponsor Program

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Matching** | Pair your exec with their exec by domain |
| **Cadence** | Minimum annual touchpoint, EBR attendance |
| **Purpose** | Strategic relationship, escalation path |
| **Activation** | At-risk situations, expansion discussions |

**Executive Sponsor Responsibilities:**
```
□ Attend EBRs for assigned accounts
□ Available for escalations within 24 hours
□ Quarterly check-in with CS on account health
□ Strategic relationship building at conferences
□ Executive-to-executive references
```

### Good Stakeholder Management

```
✓ Multi-threaded from day one
  → Identify 3+ contacts at onboarding
  → Don't wait until champion leaves

✓ Regular executive touchpoints
  → At least annual for enterprise
  → Not just when renewing

✓ Value articulation at their level
  → Executives care about business outcomes
  → Not feature adoption metrics

✓ Champion protection
  → Make champions successful internally
  → Their success = your success

✓ Blocker conversion
  → Understand their concerns
  → Address directly, don't avoid

✓ Documented relationships
  → Stakeholder map in CRM
  → Updated regularly
```

### Bad Stakeholder Management

```
✗ Single-threaded for years
  → "We have a great relationship with Sarah"
  → Sarah leaves, account at risk

✗ Only engage at renewal
  → Radio silence for 11 months
  → Transactional, not strategic

✗ Feature-focused with executives
  → "We released 12 new features!"
  → They don't care

✗ Champion taken for granted
  → No investment in their success
  → They become detractors

✗ Avoiding blockers
  → Hope they go away
  → They don't, they get louder

✗ No executive-to-executive
  → CSM is only relationship
  → Limited escalation paths
```

### Champion Departure Playbook

**Trigger:** Champion announces departure or leaves

| Timeline | Action | Owner |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Day 0 | Document all knowledge from champion | CSM |
| Day 0 | Identify interim contact | CSM |
| Day 1 | Executive outreach to their leadership | CSM + Manager |
| Day 3 | Introduction to replacement (if known) | CSM |
| Week 1 | Health score reassessment | CSM |
| Week 1 | Accelerate multi-threading | CSM |
| Week 2 | New stakeholder onboarding | CSM |
| Week 4 | Relationship assessment | CSM + Manager |

**Knowledge to capture before departure:**
```
□ Open initiatives/projects
□ Key success metrics
□ Political landscape
□ Upcoming decisions
□ Potential replacement
□ Their assessment of relationship
□ Introduction to other stakeholders
□ Permission to stay in touch (reference potential)
```

### Stakeholder Engagement Cadence

| Stakeholder | Minimum Touch | Touch Type |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **C-level** | Annual | EBR, Executive Sponsor |
| **VP** | Semi-annual | EBR, Strategic review |
| **Director** | Quarterly | QBR, Strategic discussion |
| **Manager** | Monthly | Check-in, Program update |
| **User** | Ongoing | Support, In-app |

### Relationship Strength Scoring

| Score | Definition | Indicators |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **5 - Strong** | Advocate, multi-level access | References, expansion, exec access |
| **4 - Good** | Engaged, responsive, supportive | Regular calls, positive feedback |
| **3 - Neutral** | Functional, transactional | Responds when contacted |
| **2 - Weak** | Disengaged, hard to reach | Missed meetings, slow responses |
| **1 - At risk** | Negative, avoiding | Complaints, no engagement |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Single-threading** — One relationship is not a strategy
- **Renewal-only engagement** — Transactional relationship
- **Feature pitching to executives** — Wrong level of conversation
- **Ignoring blockers** — They don't disappear
- **Champion as crutch** — Over-reliance on one person
- **No executive sponsor program** — Missed strategic leverage
- **Stakeholder map as one-time exercise** — Must be living document
- **Assuming champion loyalty** — They're loyal to their career, not you
