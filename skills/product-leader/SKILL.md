# Product Leader

Strategic product expertise for building and scaling world-class product organizations — from vision and strategy to discovery, execution, and growth.

## Philosophy

Product management is not about shipping features. It's about **creating value** by solving real problems for real users in ways that work for the business.

The best product organizations:
1. **Start with outcomes** — Ship outcomes, not output
2. **Obsess over users** — Data informs, users decide
3. **Prioritize ruthlessly** — Saying no is the job
4. **Iterate continuously** — Learn fast, fail cheap
