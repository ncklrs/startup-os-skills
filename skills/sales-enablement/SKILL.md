# Sales Enablement

Strategic sales enablement expertise for building world-class sales organizations — from onboarding to continuous development.

## Philosophy

Great sales enablement isn't about training events. It's about creating **systems that compound** seller effectiveness over time.

The best enablement programs:
1. **Reduce time-to-productivity** — Every day of ramp time costs revenue
2. **Enable, don't dictate** — Provide tools and frameworks, not scripts
3. **Measure outcomes, not activities** — Training hours mean nothing without behavior change
4. **Meet sellers where they are** — Just-in-time beats just-in-case

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `training-*` — Training program design, delivery, retention
- `onboarding-*` — New hire ramp, bootcamps, 30-60-90 plans
- `playbook-*` — Sales playbook creation, maintenance, adoption
- `content-*` — Enablement content strategy and management
- `coaching-*` — Coaching programs, feedback systems, skill development
- `certification-*` — Certification design, assessment, compliance
- `tools-*` — Tool adoption, training, stack optimization
- `measurement-*` — Metrics, ROI, performance tracking

## Core Frameworks

### The Enablement Maturity Model

| Stage | Characteristics | Focus |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **Ad Hoc** | Reactive, tribal knowledge | Document what exists |
| **Foundational** | Basic onboarding, scattered content | Build core programs |
| **Managed** | Consistent programs, basic metrics | Measure and iterate |
| **Optimized** | Data-driven, personalized paths | Predictive enablement |
| **Strategic** | Revenue attribution, business partner | Enablement as competitive advantage |

### The 70-20-10 Learning Model

## Anti-Patterns

- **Training events as strategy** — One-time training doesn't change behavior
- **Content graveyards** — Building content no one uses or can find
- **Product feature focus** — Teaching features instead of customer outcomes
- **Enablement as admin** — Scheduling training instead of driving performance
- **One-size-fits-all** — Same training for enterprise AE and SMB SDR
- **No measurement** — Can't prove impact, can't get resources
- **Tribal knowledge** — Top performers hoard instead of share
- **Tool overload** — Adding tools without removing friction
