## Contract Negotiation for Renewals

**Impact: HIGH**

Renewal negotiations differ fundamentally from new business. You're negotiating with a partner who knows your product, has leverage from their experience, and often has procurement/legal demanding "improvements" to terms. Successful renewal negotiation preserves value while maintaining the relationship.

### Renewal vs New Business Negotiation

| Dimension | New Business | Renewal |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Leverage** | Vendor has product | Customer has data/relationship |
| **Knowledge** | Customer learning | Customer expert |
| **Urgency** | Variable | Date-driven |
| **Relationship** | Building | Established |
| **Procurement** | Often bypassed | Always involved |
| **Pricing Anchor** | List price | Current contract |
| **Goal** | Win the deal | Retain + grow |

### Common Renewal Negotiation Points

| Negotiation Point | Customer Position | Vendor Approach |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Price Reduction** | "We need 20% off" | Trade for commitment, show value |
| **Payment Terms** | "Net 90 instead of Net 30" | Slight price increase |
| **Auto-Renewal Removal** | "No auto-renew" | Longer notice period |
| **Termination for Convenience** | "30-day exit clause" | Partial refund, not full |
| **SLA Improvements** | "99.99% uptime" | Premium tier discussion |
| **Liability Cap Increase** | "Cap at 2x annual fees" | Insurance verification |
| **Data Provisions** | "Return data in 30 days" | Standard practice confirmation |

### Concession Strategy Framework

| Concession Type | Give | Get | Example |

| **Service** | Enhanced support | Expansion commitment | Premium tier for upsell |
| **Timing** | Extended deadline | Early signature | 30-day extension for signature today |

### Procurement Navigation

| Procurement Tactic | Response Strategy |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **"Company policy is X"** | Understand specifics, find exceptions |
| **"Need 3 competitive quotes"** | Provide comparison materials, references |
| **"Legal must approve terms"** | Early legal engagement, standard certs |
| **"Budget locked, need discount"** | Right-size or multi-year |
| **"Auto-renew not allowed"** | Manual renewal with longer notice |
| **"Liability terms non-negotiable"** | Escalate to legal, find middle ground |

### Procurement Engagement Best Practices

```

✓ Prepare documentation
  → SOC 2, security questionnaire
  → Standard contract ready
  → Reference customers available

✓ Have a champion ally
  → Business stakeholder supports
  → Internal advocate for approval
  → Procurement doesn't operate alone

✓ Know your limits
  → What terms are truly flexible
  → Escalation for non-standard
  → Walk away if necessary
