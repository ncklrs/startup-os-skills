## Early Renewal Strategies

**Impact: HIGH**

Early renewals reduce risk, improve predictability, and demonstrate customer commitment. Converting 30-50% of renewals to early close can transform your retention metrics and forecast accuracy. The key is creating compelling incentives without training customers to always wait for deals.

### Early Renewal Incentive Framework

|----------------|-------------|----------|------------|

### Good Early Renewal Practices

```
✓ Value-first approach
  → Early renewal follows value demonstration
  → Not leading with discount
  → "Given the ROI you've achieved..."

✓ Time-limited offers
  → "Available until [date]"
  → Creates urgency without pressure
  → Clear deadline

✓ Multiple incentive options
  → Price lock OR discount OR credits
  → Customer chooses what matters
  → Flexibility within structure

✓ Easy process
  → Simple approval for customer
  → Minimal paperwork
  → Remove friction

✓ Strategic timing
  → After a big win or positive milestone
  → When budget cycles align
  → Before competitor approaches
```

### Bad Early Renewal Practices

```
✗ Always-available discounts
  → Customer learns to wait
  → Erodes pricing integrity
  → "Why didn't I get that last year?"

✗ Desperation positioning
  → "Please renew early, we need the revenue"
  → Signals weakness
  → Invites harder negotiation

✗ No value context
  → "Want to renew early for a discount?"
  → Transactional, not strategic
  → Misses relationship building

✗ Complicated process
  → New contract required
  → Legal review mandated
  → Customer gives up

✗ One-size-fits-all incentive
  → Same offer to all customers
  → Misses segment needs
  → Leaves value on table
```

### Early Renewal Conversation Framework

| **Value Recap** | Summarize achievements | "Over the past year, you've achieved X, Y, Z outcomes..." |
| **Future Vision** | Connect to roadmap | "And looking ahead, we're excited about [features] that will help you..." |
| **Strategic Timing** | Position the ask | "Given your success and our partnership, I wanted to discuss..." |
| **Incentive Intro** | Present the offer | "For customers who commit early, we're offering..." |
| **Deadline** | Create urgency | "This is available through [date] to lock in..." |
| **Easy Next Step** | Remove friction | "All you need to do is [simple action]..." |

| **Multiple contracts** | Align to single renewal date | Simplicity |
| **Recent expansion** | Bring expansion into main contract | Clean terms |
| **Acquisition** | Co-term with parent company | Enterprise alignment |
| **Subsidiary add** | Match parent renewal | Unified relationship |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Discount dependency** — Only offering early renewal with discount
- **No deadline** — "Whenever you're ready" kills urgency
- **Skipping value recap** — Transactional ask without context
- **Complicated redemption** — Incentive hard to claim
- **Inconsistent offers** — Different CSMs offering different deals
- **Public discounting** — Customer knows they can always get a deal
- **Ignoring health score** — Pushing early renewal on red accounts
- **One-shot attempt** — Giving up after first "no"
