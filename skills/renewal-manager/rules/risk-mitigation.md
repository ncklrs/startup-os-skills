## Risk Mitigation & Save Plays

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Preventing churn is 5-10x more valuable than acquiring new customers. The best renewal managers identify risk early and intervene decisively. A well-executed save play can recover 40-60% of at-risk renewals — but only if you catch them early enough.

### Risk Scoring Matrix

| Risk Level | Health Score | Renewal Probability | Action |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Green** | 80-100 | 90-95% | Standard renewal motion |
| **Yellow** | 60-79 | 75-89% | Increased engagement |
| **Orange** | 40-59 | 50-74% | Risk mitigation playbook |
| **Red** | 0-39 | <50% | Executive save play |

### Good Risk Mitigation Practices

```
✓ Early detection systems
  → Health scores monitored daily
  → Usage alerts automated
  → Engagement tracking in place
  → Champion changes flagged

✓ Proactive intervention
  → Don't wait for customer complaint
  → Reach out at first signal
  → "I noticed X, let's discuss"

✓ Root cause focus
  → Understand WHY, not just WHAT
  → Address underlying issues
  → Not just discount to save

✓ Multi-threaded relationships
  → Not dependent on one contact
  → Executive relationships maintained
  → Wide organizational presence

✓ Clear escalation paths
  → Know when to escalate
  → Management support available
  → Executive involvement when needed
```

### Bad Risk Mitigation Practices

```
✗ Ignoring early signals
  → "I'm sure it's fine"
  → Hope-based retention
  → Surprised by churn

✗ Single-threaded dependency
  → One contact leaves = chaos
  → No executive relationship
  → Vulnerable position

✗ Discount-only saves
  → Throw discount at problem
  → Root cause unaddressed
  → Temporary fix, future churn

✗ Late escalation
  → Bringing in leadership too late
  → No time for intervention
  → Damage already done

✗ Post-mortem only
  → Analysis after churn
  → No real-time action
  → Learning without preventing

### Save Play Conversation Framework

```
## Save Play Discussion Guide

1. ACKNOWLEDGE
   "I understand you're considering [concern/alternative].
   I appreciate you being direct with me."

2. DIAGNOSE
   "Help me understand what's driving this.
   What would need to change for [Company] to feel confident
   about continuing our partnership?"

3. VALIDATE
   "Those concerns make sense. Let me share what I've seen
   work for customers in similar situations..."

4. PROPOSE
   "Here's what I propose we do:
   [Specific action plan addressing root cause]
   This addresses [their concern] by [how it helps]."

5. COMMIT (MUTUAL)
   "If we do this, and you see [specific outcome],
   would that address your concern?"

6. FOLLOW THROUGH
   "I'll have [first action] done by [date].
   Can we reconnect [next meeting] to review progress?"
```

### Win-Back Strategies

| Timeframe | Approach | Success Rate |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **0-30 days post-churn** | Immediate outreach, address issue | 15-25% |
| **30-90 days** | Check-in, share improvements | 10-15% |
| **90-180 days** | Re-engagement campaign | 5-10% |
| **180+ days** | Maintain contact, wait for trigger | 2-5% |

### Win-Back Triggers

| Trigger | Why It Works | Approach |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Competitor fails** | Grass not greener | "We've improved X since you left" |
| **Champion returns** | Advocate is back | "Welcome back! Let's reconnect" |
| **New initiative** | Fresh need | "We can help with Y now" |
| **Feature launch** | Gap addressed | "We built what you needed" |
| **Market change** | Priority shift | "Given industry changes..." |

### Risk Mitigation Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Save Rate** | At-risk accounts retained | 50%+ |
| **Time to Detection** | Days from signal to flag | <14 days |
| **Time to Intervention** | Days from flag to action | <7 days |
| **Escalation Rate** | % requiring management | <20% |
| **Root Cause Resolution** | Issues actually fixed | 80%+ |
| **Repeat Risk Rate** | Same account re-risks | <10% |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Wishful thinking** — "They'll probably renew anyway"
- **Discount reflex** — Throwing discount without diagnosis
- **Late escalation** — Bringing in help when it's too late
- **Single intervention** — One action, no follow-through
- **Blame shifting** — "Product's fault" vs solving for customer
- **Giving up early** — Accepting churn without fight
- **No post-mortem** — Not learning from losses
- **Reactive only** — Never proactively checking health
