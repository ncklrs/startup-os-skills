## Expansion Attached to Renewal

**Impact: HIGH**

The renewal conversation is the most natural moment to discuss expansion. Customers are already thinking about the product, evaluating value, and making commitment decisions. Treating renewal as "retain only" misses a massive growth opportunity — best-in-class teams attach expansion to 40%+ of renewals.

### Expansion Types at Renewal

| Expansion Type | Description | Typical Lift | Complexity |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| **Seat/User Expansion** | Add more users | 10-30% | Low |
| **Tier Upgrade** | Move to higher package | 20-50% | Medium |
| **Feature Add-On** | Additional modules | 15-40% | Low-Medium |

### Good Expansion-at-Renewal Practices

```
✓ Identify opportunities early
  → 180+ days before renewal
  → Don't wait until renewal conversation
  → Build expansion into relationship

✓ Position naturally
  → "As you renew, have you considered..."
  → Growth as part of partnership
  → Not aggressive upsell

✓ Bundle effectively
  → Expansion + renewal = better deal
  → Incentive for combined decision
  → Simplifies procurement

✓ Demonstrate value first
  → Current ROI proven
  → Success creates appetite
  → Expansion as logical next step

✓ Right-size the ask
  → Realistic expansion scope
  → Phased if needed
  → Customer success > revenue push
```

### Bad Expansion-at-Renewal Practices

```
✗ Renewal-only focus
  → "Just get them to sign"
  → Miss growth opportunity
  → Leave money on table

✗ Aggressive upselling
  → "You need to upgrade"
  → Pressured, transactional
  → Damages relationship

✗ Wrong timing
  → Expansion pitch to at-risk customer
  → Growth before value proven
  → Tone deaf

✗ No incentive structure
  → Same price separate or together
  → No reason to combine
  → Complexity without benefit

✗ Separate conversations
  → Renewal now, expansion later
  → Loses momentum
  → Additional procurement cycle
```

### Expansion Opportunity Identification

|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Power users hitting limits** | Seat/usage upgrade | "Your team is maxing out..." |
| **Feature requests** | Tier upgrade or add-on | "That's in our Premium tier..." |
| **New hire announcements** | Seat expansion | "As you grow, we can..." |
| **New initiatives mentioned** | Cross-sell | "That aligns with our [product]..." |
| **Department interest** | Expansion deal | "Other teams have asked about..." |
| **Geographic growth** | Regional expansion | "As you expand to [region]..." |
| **Budget cycle starting** | All types | "With new budget available..." |

### Expansion Sizing Framework

|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|

| Basic tier | Standard tier (+25-40%) | Premium tier (+50-100%) |
| 1 product | +1 add-on (+20-35%) | Full suite (+100%+) |
