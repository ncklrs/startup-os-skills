## Channel Partner Enablement

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Partners can only sell what they understand. Great enablement turns partners into extensions of your sales team. Poor enablement leaves partners confused and customers underserved.

| **Product Training** | Feature knowledge | Critical | Per release |
| **Battle Cards** | Competitive positioning | High | Monthly |
| **Case Studies** | Social proof | High | Quarterly |
| **Demo Scripts** | Consistent messaging | High | Quarterly |
| **Objection Handling** | Overcome resistance | High | Monthly |
| **Pricing Guide** | Deal structuring | High | As needed |
| **Technical Docs** | Implementation | Medium | Per release |
| **Co-brandable Assets** | Marketing materials | Medium | Quarterly |
