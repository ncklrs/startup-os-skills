**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

### Anti-Patterns

- **Single-threaded** — When your contact leaves, relationship dies
- **Reactive only** — Only talking when there's a problem
- **No data tracking** — Can't identify at-risk partners
- **Inconsistent communication** — Months of silence then urgent asks
- **Over-promising** — Commitments you can't keep destroy trust
- **Ignoring feedback** — Partners tell you what's wrong, you don't act
- **One-size-fits-all** — Top partners need different treatment than long-tail
- **No executive engagement** — Strategic partners need exec relationships
- **Treating partners as transactions** — Relationships drive long-term value
