## Positioning Against Alternatives

**Impact: HIGH**

Positioning is about owning a space in the buyer's mind. You don't control what competitors say, but you control how you're perceived relative to them.

### Positioning Strategy Types

| Strategy | When to Use | Approach | Risk |
|----------|-------------|----------|------|
| **Head-to-head** | You're demonstrably better | Direct comparison | Need to prove claims |
| **Niche down** | Can't beat market leader broadly | Own specific segment | Limits TAM |
| **Reframe** | Losing on current criteria | Change evaluation criteria | Requires education |
| **Leapfrog** | Have unique capability | Focus on future | Can seem vaporware |
| **Coexist** | Different jobs to be done | Complement, don't compete | May confuse buyers |

### Head-to-Head Positioning

```
Use when:
- You objectively outperform on key dimensions
- Buyer already knows competitor
- You have proof points

Example:
"Faster than [Competitor]" → Back it up with benchmarks
```

#### Good Head-to-Head

```
✓ "50% faster deploys than [Competitor]"
  → Specific, measurable, verifiable

✓ "Rated higher on G2 for ease of use"
  → Third-party validation

✓ "Chosen by [Customer] after evaluating [Competitor]"
  → Social proof from credible source
```

#### Bad Head-to-Head

```
✗ "Better than [Competitor]"
  → Vague, subjective, no proof

✗ "The only real solution"
  → Arrogant, dismissive

✗ "They're outdated"
  → Negative, may not be true
```

### Niche-Down Positioning

```
Use when:
- Can't win across all dimensions
- Have specific segment strength
- Segment is underserved

Formula:
"The [category] for [specific segment]"
```

#### Niche Positioning Examples

| Broad Competitor | Your Niche Position |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "The CRM" | "The CRM for startups under 50 employees" |
| "Enterprise secrets management" | "Secrets management for developer teams" |
| "The analytics platform" | "Analytics built for product teams" |

### Reframe Positioning

```
Use when:
- Losing on current evaluation criteria
- Criteria aren't actually what matters
- Can educate on what should matter

Approach:
"You're evaluating on X, but what actually matters is Y"
```

#### Good Reframe

```
Competitor wins on: Number of features
Your reframe: "More features = more complexity. Here's what happens when tools are too complex: [evidence of failure]"

Competitor wins on: Brand recognition
Your reframe: "Established vendors optimize for enterprise. Here's what gets deprioritized: [SMB needs they ignore]"

Competitor wins on: Price (they're cheaper)
Your reframe: "Initial cost is 20% of total cost. Here's the full picture: [TCO comparison]"
```

### Leapfrog Positioning

```
Use when:
- You have unique technology/capability
- Market is evolving in your direction
- Competitor can't easily copy

Formula:
"The first/only [capability] for [outcome]"
```

### Positioning Framework: The 3 Cs

| Component | Question | Output |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Company** | What are we uniquely good at? | Capabilities, proof |
| **Customer** | What do buyers actually need? | Jobs to be done |
| **Competition** | What do alternatives offer? | Gap analysis |

```
Strong positioning sits at the intersection:
Something you do well + customers care about + competitors don't offer
```

### Positioning Statement Template

```
For [target customer]
Who [has this need/pain]
[Our product] is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [primary alternative]
We [key differentiator]

Example:

For engineering teams at growth-stage startups
Who need to manage secrets without security overhead
SecretStash is a secrets management platform
That provides developer-first security with zero configuration
Unlike enterprise solutions that require dedicated security teams
We integrate in 5 minutes and grow with you
```

### Differentiation Proof Matrix

| Differentiator | Evidence Type | Strength |
|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Claim | Your marketing says it | Weak |
| Feature | Product demonstrates it | Medium |
| Third-party | Analysts/reviewers confirm | Strong |
| Customer proof | Buyers validate it | Strongest |

### Good Differentiation

```
✓ Meaningful: Matters to buyers
✓ Verifiable: Can be demonstrated
✓ Defensible: Hard to copy quickly
✓ Consistent: True across product/company
```

### Bad Differentiation

```
✗ "Best customer support"
  → Everyone says this, hard to prove

✗ "Most innovative"
  → Subjective, meaningless

✗ "Enterprise-grade"
  → Overused, means nothing specific

✗ Features that are table stakes
  → "We have an API" isn't differentiation in 2024
```

### Competitive Positioning Do's and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Lead with your strengths | Lead with their weaknesses |
| Be specific and provable | Make vague claims |
| Acknowledge their strengths honestly | Pretend they have no strengths |
| Focus on buyer outcomes | Focus on feature lists |
| Update as market shifts | Set and forget positioning |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Positioning by negation** — "We're not [competitor]" isn't a position
- **Feature parity obsession** — Matching features doesn't differentiate
- **Ignoring the real alternative** — Often it's "do nothing"
- **One position fits all** — Different segments need different emphasis
- **Positioning wish** — Claiming position you can't prove
- **Competitor reaction** — Changing position every time they move
