## Thought Leadership Content

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Thought leadership builds authority by sharing unique perspectives, not regurgitating conventional wisdom.

### What Makes It "Thought Leadership"

| Is | Is Not |
|-----|--------|
| Original perspective | Summarizing others' ideas |
| Based on experience | Pure speculation |
| Takes a stance | Wishy-washy "it depends" |
| Challenges assumptions | Agreeing with consensus |
| Offers frameworks | Just describing problems |

### The Thought Leadership Formula

```
[Conventional wisdom] is wrong because [your insight].

Here's what I've learned from [your experience]:
[Framework / new way of thinking]
```

### Good Example

```
"Shift left on security" is a lie we tell ourselves.

After 10 years in DevSecOps, I've realized: we're not actually
shifting security left. We're just adding security tools earlier
in the pipeline while keeping the same reactive mindset.

Real shift-left means developers WANT to think about security—
not because they have to pass a gate, but because they
understand why it matters.

Here's the framework that actually worked for my team...

### Bad Example

```
Security is really important in today's world.

Many experts agree that "shifting left" is a best practice.
According to Gartner, organizations should integrate security
earlier in the development process.

Here are some tips for better security...

### Finding Your Angle

Ask yourself:
- What do I believe that most people in my field don't?
- What have I learned the hard way that others haven't?
- What conventional wisdom have I proven wrong?
- What pattern have I noticed that others miss?

### Structure for Thought Leadership

```
1. Hook: Challenge a belief or share a surprising insight
2. Credibility: Why should you listen to me on this?
3. Framework: Your mental model or approach
4. Evidence: Examples, stories, data from your experience
5. Application: How readers can apply this
6. Invitation: Continue the conversation
```

### Voice Guidelines

- **Confident but not arrogant** — "I've found" not "everyone should"
- **Specific not vague** — Real numbers, real stories
- **Humble about limits** — "In my experience" not "this is universal truth"
- **Inviting disagreement** — "I'd love to hear if you've seen different"

### Anti-Patterns

- **Stating the obvious** — "Communication is important"
- **No personal experience** — Just aggregating others' thoughts
- **Both-sidesing** — "Some say X, others say Y, both are valid"
- **Clickbait without substance** — Provocative headline, generic content
