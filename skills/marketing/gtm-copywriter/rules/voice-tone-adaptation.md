## Tone Adaptation by Context

**Impact: HIGH**

Same voice, different tone. Adjust formality and energy to context.

### The Tone Spectrum

```
Formal ←————————————————————————→ Casual
Enterprise | Professional | Conversational | Friendly | Playful
```

### Tone by Situation

| Situation | Tone | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Error message | Calm, helpful | They're frustrated |
| Payment failed | Professional, urgent | Serious but not scary |
| Feature launch | Enthusiastic, clear | Excitement without hype |
| Security incident | Formal, direct | Trust is at stake |
| Welcome email | Warm, helpful | First impression |
| Upgrade prompt | Confident, value-focused | Not pushy |
| Win-back email | Understanding, low-pressure | They left for a reason |

### Same Message, Different Tones

**Formal (Enterprise):**
```
We are pleased to announce the general availability of
environment-based secret management. This capability enables
teams to maintain distinct configurations across development,
staging, and production environments.
```

**Professional (B2B SaaS):**
```
Environments are here. You can now manage separate secrets for
dev, staging, and production—no more accidental production
deployments with test credentials.
```

**Conversational (Modern startup):**
```
You asked, we built: Environments! 🎉

Keep your dev secrets away from prod. Finally.
```

**Casual (Personal/Twitter):**
```
shipped environments today

no more "oh god was that the prod database" moments

you're welcome
```

### Tone Markers

| Marker | Formal | Casual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Contractions | Do not | Don't |
| Emoji | Never | Sparingly to frequently |
| Sentence fragments | Never | Sometimes |
| Exclamation points | Rarely | More often |
| First person | We (company) | I, we |
| Humor | Subtle or none | When natural |

### Anti-Pattern

Mismatched tone destroys trust. A playful tone in a security alert feels irresponsible. A formal tone in a welcome email feels cold.
