## Embargo and Exclusive Strategy

**Impact: HIGH**

Embargoes and exclusives are powerful tools when used correctly, and relationship-destroying weapons when misused. Understanding when and how to use each is critical PR strategy.

### Embargo vs Exclusive: Key Differences

| Aspect | Embargo | Exclusive |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Definition** | Multiple outlets, same release time | One outlet, first to publish |
| **Journalist commitment** | Agree not to publish until lift | Agree to publish by deadline |
| **Your commitment** | Don't give to non-embargoed outlets | Don't pitch to anyone else |
| **Coverage quantity** | Multiple stories at once | One story, maybe follow-on |
| **Coverage quality** | Standard coverage | Often deeper, feature-length |
| **Best for** | Maximum same-day impact | Major news, deeper story |

### When to Use Each

| Strategy | Use When | Don't Use When |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Embargo** | Multiple outlets will cover, want coordinated splash | News isn't strong enough for broad coverage |
| **Exclusive** | Tier 1 outlet, want feature treatment | News is time-sensitive and must go wide |
| **Neither** | News is moderate, relationship building | You have major news warranting coordination |
| **Soft exclusive** | "First to publish" but others can follow | You need guaranteed coverage |

### The Embargo Process

```
Timeline: 2-3 weeks before announcement

Week -3 to -2:
├── Draft press release and materials
├── Identify target journalists (usually 5-15)
├── Confirm news warrants embargo
└── Prepare embargo agreement language

Week -2 to -1:
├── Send embargo pitches to Tier 1 first
├── Get explicit confirmation of embargo acceptance
├── Schedule briefings/interviews
└── Send materials to confirmed participants

Week -1:
├── Expand to Tier 2-3 if appropriate
├── Conduct briefings
├── Answer journalist questions
└── Confirm everyone has what they need

Day of lift:
├── Confirm timing with all participants
├── Distribute press release at lift time
└── Be available for day-of questions
└── Monitor coverage, thank journalists
```

### Embargo Pitch Template

```
Subject: [Exclusive] Embargo opportunity: [Headline]

Hi [Name],

[One sentence on why this is relevant to their beat]

We're announcing [brief description of news] on [date]. Given your
coverage of [beat], I'd like to offer you an embargo briefing.

Embargo lifts: [Day], [Date], [Time] [Timezone]

Key points:
• [Bullet 1]
• [Bullet 2]
• [Bullet 3]

Interested in a briefing? I can also provide [data/demo/exec access].

If this isn't for you, please let me know and I'll remove you from
embargo communications.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Embargo Rules of Engagement

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Get explicit acceptance** | "Yes, I accept the embargo" in writing |
| **Confirm timing precisely** | Include timezone, never ambiguous |
| **Honor commitments** | If you offer exclusive data, deliver it |
| **Don't over-invite** | 5-15 journalists, not 50 |
| **Prepare for breaks** | Have a plan if someone publishes early |
| **Respect "no"** | If they decline, don't share embargo info |

### Good Embargo Practices

```
✓ "Please confirm you accept the embargo before I send materials."
  → Explicit acceptance required

✓ "Embargo lifts Wednesday, March 15 at 6:00am ET / 3:00am PT"
  → No ambiguity on timing

✓ "If this isn't relevant to your coverage, no need to respond—
   I'll just remove you from this embargo list."
  → Easy out, no pressure

✓ Sending embargo reminder 24 hours before lift
  → Ensures everyone is aligned
```

### Bad Embargo Practices

```
✗ "Sending you this under embargo" [without asking for acceptance]
  → They never agreed, not bound

✗ "Embargo lifts Wednesday morning"
  → Morning where? What timezone?

✗ Adding journalists to embargo after some have already published
  → Creates confusion and unfairness

✗ Offering the same "exclusive" to multiple outlets
  → Fastest way to destroy trust
```

### The Exclusive Process

```
Step 1: Identify the right outlet
├── Is this story big enough for them?
├── Do they cover this beat deeply?
├── What's your relationship with them?
└── Can they publish when you need?

Step 2: Make the offer
├── Clearly state it's an exclusive
├── Define what "exclusive" means (time period, scope)
├── Provide timeline expectations
└── Get commitment before sharing details

Step 3: Deliver exceptional access
├── Full exec interview time
├── Customer references
├── Data and visuals
├── Anything they need for a great story

Step 4: After publication
├── Share and amplify their story
├── Hold off other pitches as agreed
├── Don't undermine with competitive coverage
└── Thank them and maintain relationship
```

### Exclusive Offer Template

```
Subject: Exclusive for [Outlet]: [One line hook]

Hi [Name],

I have an exclusive I think would fit your [beat] coverage.

[Company] is [one sentence news]. This would give [Outlet] the first
look at [why it matters], including:

• [Unique access point 1]
• [Unique access point 2]
• [Data/customer/exec access]

Timeline: We're hoping to have this publish by [date]. Does that work
for your schedule?

If this is interesting, I can send full details and set up a call with
our [CEO/relevant exec].

Best,
[Name]
```

### Exclusive vs Embargo Decision Matrix

| Factor | Favors Exclusive | Favors Embargo |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Story complexity | High (needs depth) | Low-medium |
| Relationship | Strong with one outlet | Strong with many |
| Desired coverage | One deep feature | Many simultaneous mentions |
| Time sensitivity | Can wait for their schedule | Need specific date |
| News significance | Major (funding, acquisition) | Important but not major |
| Follow-on potential | Want cascade of coverage | Want one big moment |

### Timing Considerations

| Announcement Type | Typical Embargo Lead Time |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Funding round | 1-2 weeks |
| Product launch | 2-3 weeks |
| Partnership | 1-2 weeks |
| Executive hire | 1 week |
| Acquisition | 1-3 weeks (often complex) |
| Research/report | 2-4 weeks |

### Handling Embargo Breaks

If someone publishes before the embargo lifts:

```
Immediate:
├── Confirm the break (is it really your story?)
├── Contact the breaking outlet (may be accidental)
├── Notify all embargoed journalists
└── Release embargo immediately if significant break

Communication to embargoed journalists:
"Unfortunately, [outlet] broke embargo. We're releasing immediately
so you can publish at your discretion. Apologies for the disruption—
we're addressing this with the outlet directly."
```

### Protecting Against Breaks

- Only embargo journalists you trust
- Get explicit written acceptance
- Watermark sensitive documents
- Stagger information sharing (basics first, details closer to lift)
- Have a rapid-release plan ready

### After the Embargo Lifts

| Timing | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Lift time** | Wide distribution of press release |
| **First hour** | Available for journalist questions |
| **Same day** | Monitor coverage, share/engage |
| **Day 2** | Follow up with non-covering journalists |
| **Week 1** | Pitch secondary angles to non-covered |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Fake exclusives** — Offering same "exclusive" to competitors
- **Infinite embargo** — Journalists waiting weeks with no lift date
- **Embargo everything** — Not all news warrants coordination
- **Last-minute additions** — Adding journalists day before lift
- **No break plan** — Scrambling when someone publishes early
- **Retaliation** — Punishing outlets that couldn't cover
- **Scope creep** — Expanding story during embargo confuses journalists
- **Silent treatment** — Not confirming lift or providing updates
