# PR Specialist

Expert public relations guidance for earned media strategy, media relations, and reputation building — from press releases to crisis communication.

## Philosophy

Great PR is earned, not bought:

1. **Build relationships before you need them** — Journalists remember who helped them, not who pitched them
2. **Newsworthy first, company second** — Lead with the story, not the press release
3. **Credibility compounds** — Every interaction builds or erodes your reputation
4. **Measure what matters** — Coverage quality beats clip counting

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `media-*` — Media relations, journalist outreach, relationship building
- `content-*` — Press releases, media pitches, press kits
- `strategy-*` — Embargo strategies, exclusives, launch timing
- `crisis-*` — Crisis communication, reputation management
- `thought-*` — Thought leadership placement, bylines, speaking
- `analyst-*` — Analyst relations and briefings
- `awards-*` — Award submissions and recognition programs
- `measurement-*` — Coverage tracking, share of voice, PR metrics

## Core Frameworks

### The Newsworthiness Test

| Factor | Question | Weight |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Timeliness** | Is it happening now? | High |
| **Impact** | Who does this affect and how many? | High |
| **Proximity** | Is it relevant to this audience? | Medium |
| **Prominence** | Are notable people/companies involved? | Medium |
| **Novelty** | Is this a first, biggest, or unexpected? | High |
| **Conflict** | Does it challenge convention? | Medium |
| **Human Interest** | Is there an emotional story? | Medium |

### Media Tier Framework

| Tier | Examples | Characteristics | Approach |
|------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | TechCrunch, WSJ, NYT | Highest reach, hardest to get | Exclusives, major news only |
| **Tier 2** | VentureBeat, Forbes contributor | Strong reach, more accessible | Embargoes, regular pitching |
| **Tier 3** | Industry publications, podcasts | Niche but influential | Consistent relationship building |
| **Tier 4** | Blogs, newsletters, substacks | Targeted, often undervalued | Direct relationships, content |

### Pitch Response Matrix

| Response | Meaning | Next Action |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **No response** | Wrong timing, topic, or journalist | Try different angle or wait |
| **"Not for me"** | Wrong beat or outlet | Ask for referral |
| **"Send more info"** | Interest, needs validation | Provide what's asked, quickly |
| **"Not now, maybe later"** | Good relationship, wrong timing | Add to follow-up calendar |
| **"Let's talk"** | Strong interest | Prepare thoroughly, respond fast |

## Relationship Building Principles

### The 10:1 Rule

For every pitch, provide 10 value-adds:
- Share their articles
- Send relevant tips (not for you)
- Make introductions
- Respond to their requests
- Engage meaningfully on social

### Coverage Quality Hierarchy

| Level | Description | Value |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Feature story** | In-depth coverage, multiple sources | Highest |
| **News mention** | Coverage of your announcement | High |
| **Expert quote** | Your exec quoted in trend story | Medium-High |
| **Product mention** | Brief mention in roundup/list | Medium |
| **Backlink only** | Link without context | Low |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Spray and pray** — Mass emailing the same pitch to 500 journalists
- **Pitching your press release** — "Please publish our press release" is not news
- **Forgetting the journalist** — They write for readers, not for your company
- **Embargo abuse** — Breaking embargoes burns bridges permanently
- **Metrics theater** — Counting clips instead of measuring impact
- **Crisis silence** — No comment is a comment (usually bad)
- **One-and-done outreach** — PR is relationships, not transactions
- **Overvaluing Tier 1** — Niche coverage often converts better
