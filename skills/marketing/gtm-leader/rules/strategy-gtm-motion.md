## Choosing Your GTM Motion

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Your GTM motion determines everything — team structure, content strategy, metrics, and how you spend your time.

### The Five GTM Motions

| Motion | How You Win | Best For | Team Focus |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Product-Led (PLG)** | Free tier → self-serve conversion | Low ACV (<$1k), horizontal tools | Product, growth engineering |
| **Sales-Led** | Outbound → demo → close | High ACV (>$50k), complex sales | Sales, SDRs, AEs |
| **Marketing-Led** | Inbound → MQL → sales | Mid-market, considered purchases | Demand gen, content |
| **Community-Led** | Community → trust → adoption | Dev tools, platforms, open source | DevRel, community managers |
| **Founder-Led** | Personal brand → trust → sales | Early stage, all segments | Founder time |

### Choosing Your Primary Motion

**PLG if:**
- Users can experience value in < 5 minutes
- ACV < $1,000/year
- Low switching costs
- Individual user can adopt without approval

**Sales-Led if:**
- ACV > $50,000/year
- Complex implementation
- Multiple stakeholders involved
- Compliance/security requirements

**Community-Led if:**
- Developer/technical audience
- Platform or tool ecosystem
- Strong network effects
- Open source component

**Founder-Led if:**
- Pre-product-market fit
- Building in public
- High-trust sale (security, finance)
- Founder has unique credibility

### Motion Combinations

Most successful SaaS companies combine motions:

```
Early Stage:    Founder-Led → PLG
                (Build audience, then launch product)

Growth Stage:   PLG + Community-Led
                (Self-serve + ecosystem)

Scale Stage:    PLG + Sales-Led
                (Self-serve + enterprise sales team)
```

### Metrics by Motion

| Motion | North Star | Leading Indicators |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| PLG | Activation rate | Signups, time-to-value, PQL rate |
| Sales-Led | Revenue | Meetings booked, SQL rate, close rate |
| Marketing-Led | Pipeline | MQLs, content engagement, demo requests |
| Community-Led | Active community | Members, engagement, contributions |
| Founder-Led | Founder reach | Followers, engagement, DM conversations |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Motion mismatch** — PLG for enterprise compliance software
- **Too many motions** — Trying everything, excelling at nothing
- **Ignoring founder-led** — Every early-stage company should do this
- **Premature sales team** — Hiring AEs before you have repeatable sales
