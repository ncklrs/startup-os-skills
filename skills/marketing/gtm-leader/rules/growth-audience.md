## Audience Building

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Audience is a moat. An email list and social following you own is more valuable than any paid channel.

### The Audience Hierarchy

```
Most Valuable ↑
    │
    │  Email subscribers (you own it)
    │  Community members (high engagement)
    │  YouTube subscribers (intent-rich)
    │  LinkedIn followers (B2B gold)
    │  Twitter/X followers (influence)
    │  TikTok followers (reach)
    │  Instagram followers
    │
Least Valuable ↓
```

### Audience Before Product

**Why build audience first:**
- Validate ideas before building
- Free distribution when you launch
- Built-in beta testers
- Warm investor conversations
- Recruit from your followers

**When to build:**
- 6-12 months before launch: Ideal
- At launch: Still valuable
- After launch: Playing catch-up

### The 1,000 True Fans Math

```
1,000 true fans × $100/year = $100,000/year

For SaaS:
1,000 true fans → 100 trials → 30 customers → $30k ARR (low)
10,000 engaged followers → 1,000 trials → 300 customers → $300k ARR
```

**True fans:** People who will buy everything, share everything, defend you

### Audience Building Tactics

**Phase 1: 0 → 1,000**
- Post consistently (daily if possible)
- Engage heavily (80% engaging, 20% creating)
- Reply to bigger accounts in your space
- Join communities and add value
- Cross-promote with similar-sized accounts

**Phase 2: 1,000 → 10,000**
- Increase content quality
- Start threads/long-form content
- Collaborate with larger accounts
- Repurpose across platforms
- Build email list in parallel

**Phase 3: 10,000+**
- Focus on depth over breadth
- Create signature content series
- Build community (Discord, Slack)
- Develop owned media (newsletter, podcast)
- Leverage audience for launches

### Multi-Platform Strategy

**Don't spread thin. Sequence:**

```
Phase 1: Own one platform
(Usually Twitter or LinkedIn for B2B)

Phase 2: Add YouTube or newsletter
(Long-form depth)

Phase 3: Add second social
(Cross-pollinate audiences)

Phase 4: Add emerging platform
(TikTok, etc. for discovery)
```

### Email List Building

**The asset you own.** Social platforms can change algorithms; email is yours.

**Capture strategies:**
- Content upgrade (checklist, template)
- Newsletter signup
- Free tool/resource
- Waitlist for product
- Webinar/event registration

**Growth math:**
```
If 2% of social followers subscribe
10,000 followers = 200 email subscribers

If you post lead magnet 1x/week
+ 20 subscribers/week = 1,000/year
```

### Community Building

**Community > Audience**
- Audience watches you
- Community talks to each other

**When to start:**
- After 1,000+ engaged followers
- When you see repeat commenters
- When people ask for it

**Platform options:**
| Platform | Best For | Effort |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Discord | Real-time, younger, developers | High |
| Slack | Professional, B2B | Medium |
| Circle | Courses, paid communities | Medium |
| GitHub Discussions | Open source | Low |

### Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Email subscribers** | Owned audience, highest intent |
| **Engagement rate** | Quality > quantity |
| **DM conversations** | Relationship depth |
| **Reply rate** | Are people talking back? |
| **Referrals** | Are people sharing you? |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Buying followers** — Kills engagement rate, fools no one
- **Engagement pods** — Fake engagement, algorithm detects
- **Follow/unfollow** — Spammy, burns bridges
- **Only promoting** — Give value first, ask second
- **Platform dependence** — Always build email list
