## Bundles and Add-ons Strategy

**Impact: HIGH**

Strategic bundling increases perceived value and average deal size. Add-ons create expansion revenue without tier redesign. Both require careful design to avoid complexity.

### Bundle Psychology

```
Individual Products:
├── Product A: $100/mo (worth $100)
├── Product B: $80/mo (worth $80)
└── Product C: $60/mo (worth $60)
    Total separate: $240/mo

Bundle:
└── All three: $180/mo (25% discount)
    → Perceived value: $240
    → Price: $180
    → Perceived savings: $60/mo
    → Customer: "Great deal!"
    → You: Higher ACV, lower churn, stickier
```

### Bundle Types

| Type | Structure | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Pure bundling** | Only sold together | Suite products |
| **Mixed bundling** | Separate or together | Flexibility |
| **Leader bundling** | Popular item + extras | Cross-sell |
| **Joint bundling** | Equal partners | Platform plays |
| **Customizable** | Pick X of Y | Complex needs |

### Bundle Design Framework

| Element | Consideration |
|---------|---------------|
| **Complementarity** | Do products work better together? |
| **Value creation** | Is bundle worth more than sum? |
| **Simplification** | Does it reduce decision complexity? |
| **Price anchor** | Does individual pricing create anchor? |
| **Cannibalization** | Does it cannibalize higher-margin products? |

### Good Bundle Examples

```
✓ Atlassian Cloud Premium:
"Jira + Confluence + Jira Service Management"
→ Products that work together
→ Clear use case (software team)
→ Discount vs separate purchases

✓ Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps:
"Every creative app for one price"
→ Simplifies decision
→ Encourages exploration
→ Strong lock-in

✓ Microsoft 365 Business:
"Office + Email + Teams + OneDrive"
→ Complete solution
→ Hard to unbundle
→ High switching costs
```

### Bad Bundle Examples

```
✗ Random products bundled:
"Analytics + Email + Project Management"
→ No logical connection
→ Buyer doesn't need all three

✗ Bundle cheaper than anchor:
Individual total: $150, Bundle: $140
→ Weak discount, not compelling

✗ Hidden required add-on:
"$99/mo + required $50/mo support package"
→ Feels deceptive, not a real bundle

✗ Forced bundling of unwanted features:
"To get SSO, you need the Enterprise suite"
→ Creates resentment, not value
```

### Add-on Strategy

| Add-on Type | Description | Pricing Model |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Feature add-on** | Additional capability | Flat monthly fee |
| **Usage add-on** | Extra capacity | Per-unit or block |
| **Service add-on** | Premium support | Percentage of base |
| **Integration add-on** | Third-party connectors | Per integration or flat |
| **Compliance add-on** | Security/compliance | Premium tier or flat |

### Add-on Pricing Guidelines

| Principle | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Relative pricing** | Add-on should be 10-30% of base |
| **Value clarity** | Clear ROI for the add-on |
| **Optional feel** | Core product works without it |
| **Expansion path** | Leads to tier upgrade eventually |

### Good Add-on Examples

```
✓ Priority support add-on:
Base plan: $99/mo
+ Priority support: $29/mo (24-hour SLA → 2-hour SLA)
→ Clear value, reasonable price

✓ Additional storage:
Base: 100GB included
+ 100GB block: $10/mo
→ Predictable, scales with need

✓ SSO add-on:
Pro plan: $99/mo
+ SSO: $49/mo (vs Enterprise at $299/mo)
→ Lets Pro customers get one feature without full upgrade
```

### Bad Add-on Examples

```
✗ Essential feature as add-on:
"Export your data: +$25/mo"
→ Should be included, feels extractive

✗ Add-on more expensive than tier jump:
Pro: $99/mo
Pro + Analytics: $99 + $150 = $249/mo
Business (includes analytics): $199/mo
→ Confusing, punishes add-on buyers

✗ Invisible add-on costs:
"Per-user fee + storage fee + API fee + support fee"
→ Impossible to understand total cost
```

### Add-on Discovery and Adoption

| Touchpoint | Add-on Presentation |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Pricing page** | Show as optional extras |
| **Checkout** | "Add premium support for $X/mo" |
| **In-app** | Feature gate with upgrade prompt |
| **Usage limit** | "You've hit your limit. Add more?" |
| **CSM outreach** | Personalized recommendation |

### Bundle vs Add-on Decision

| Scenario | Use Bundle | Use Add-on |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Products always used together | Yes | No |
| Feature appeals to subset | No | Yes |
| Simplifying product line | Yes | No |
| Expansion revenue goal | Maybe | Yes |
| Competitive response | Yes | No |
| Complex buyer needs | No | Yes |

### Cross-Sell and Upsell Framework

```
Upsell Path (vertical):
Starter → Pro → Business → Enterprise
Same product, more features/capacity

Cross-Sell Path (horizontal):
Core Product → Add-on A
              → Add-on B
              → Add-on C
Related products, complementary value

Bundle Path (diagonal):
Core + Add-on A + Add-on B = "Complete Package"
Combines cross-sell into simplified offering
```

### Revenue Expansion Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Attach rate** | % of customers with add-on | 20-40% |
| **Expansion revenue** | Revenue from existing customers | 30%+ of total |
| **Net revenue retention** | Revenue from cohort after 12mo | 110-130% |
| **Add-on ARPU** | Average add-on revenue per customer | Track trend |

### Add-on Cannibalizing Core

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Add-on replaces tier upgrade | Price add-on close to tier difference |
| Customers feel nickel-and-dimed | Limit total add-on options |
| Complexity increases churn | Bundle popular combinations |
| Support burden | Self-service add-on management |

### Partner and Integration Bundles

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Tech partner bundle** | Your product + partner product | "Slack + Zoom + Asana" |
| **Service partner** | Product + implementation | "Software + consulting package" |
| **Reseller bundle** | Discounted for reseller margin | White-label partnerships |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Too many add-ons** — Decision paralysis, support complexity
- **Nickel-and-diming** — Every feature is an add-on
- **Essential features gated** — Core functionality held hostage
- **Confusing bundles** — Overlap between bundles and tiers
- **Forced bundles** — No option to buy components separately
- **Add-on bloat** — Adding add-ons without pruning
- **Unclear pricing** — Can't calculate total cost
- **Bundle that increases churn** — Customers paying for unused products
