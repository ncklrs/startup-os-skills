## Discounts and Annual vs Monthly Positioning

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Strategic discounting can accelerate growth; undisciplined discounting destroys margins and trains customers to wait. Annual vs monthly framing significantly impacts LTV and cash flow.

### The Discount Spectrum

| Type | When Appropriate | Risk Level |
|------|------------------|------------|
| **Annual commitment** | Always offer | Low |
| **Volume/seat** | Large teams | Low |
| **Startup/nonprofit** | Qualified programs | Low-Medium |
| **Seasonal/launch** | Rare, strategic | Medium |
| **Win-back** | Churned customers | Medium |
| **Competitive match** | Proven alternative | Medium-High |
| **Ad-hoc negotiation** | Enterprise only | High |

### Annual vs Monthly Economics

```
Monthly at $99/mo:
├── Year 1 Revenue: $1,188 (if no churn)
├── Typical churn: 5-8% monthly
├── Expected Year 1: ~$900
└── Payment: 12 transactions

Annual at $948/yr ($79/mo equivalent):
├── Year 1 Revenue: $948 (guaranteed)
├── Churn: Annual renewal point only
├── Expected Year 1: $948
└── Payment: 1 transaction, upfront cash
```

### Annual Discount Guidelines

| Discount | Positioning | Typical Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **0% (same price)** | "Convenience of annual" | Premium products |
| **10-15%** | "Save ~1 month" | Standard SaaS |
| **17-20%** | "2 months free" | Most common |
| **25%+** | "3+ months free" | Growth-focused |

### Framing Annual Savings

| Frame | Example | Psychology |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Months free** | "Get 2 months free" | Concrete gain |
| **Percentage off** | "Save 20%" | Standard discount |
| **Dollar savings** | "Save $240/year" | Tangible money |
| **Daily cost** | "Just $2.60/day" | Minimizes perception |

### Good Annual Framing

```
✓ Toggle Design:
[Monthly $99/mo]  [Annual $79/mo — Save $240]

✓ Explicit savings:
"Pay annually and get 2 months free"

✓ Breakdown:
"$948/year = $79/month (billed annually)
 You save $240 compared to monthly"

✓ Comparison:
"Monthly: $1,188/year
 Annual: $948/year (20% off)"
```

### Bad Annual Framing

```
✗ Confusing display:
"$79/mo (annual) or $99/mo"
→ Which is which? Confusing.

✗ Hidden billing:
"$79/mo" (small print: billed as $948 annually)
→ Feels deceptive

✗ Discount feels fake:
"Annual: $79/mo (was $199/mo)"
→ Nobody believes the fake anchor

✗ No toggle, only annual:
Hides monthly option entirely
→ Reduces trust
```

### Startup Program Design

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Discount level** | 50-90% off for 1-2 years |
| **Eligibility** | VC-backed, <2 years old, <$5M raised |
| **Application** | Simple form, quick approval |
| **Graduation** | Clear path to paid at program end |
| **Value** | It's marketing—feature prominently |

### Good Startup Program

```
✓ Startups get 75% off Year 1

Eligibility:
• Less than $2M in funding
• Less than 2 years since founding
• Less than 20 employees

Apply with a 2-minute form.
Most applications approved within 24 hours.
```

### Nonprofit/Education Discounts

| Segment | Typical Discount | Verification |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **Nonprofits** | 25-50% off | 501(c)(3), charity status |
| **Education** | 50-90% off | .edu email, institution |
| **Open source** | Free or 90% off | Public repo, contributors |
| **Government** | 10-25% off | .gov domain, contract |

### Promotional Discount Types

| Type | Duration | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Launch** | 1-4 weeks | New product/feature launch |
| **Holiday** | 1-7 days | Black Friday, end of year |
| **Anniversary** | 1-2 weeks | Company/product birthday |
| **Win-back** | Limited | Re-engage churned customers |
| **Referral** | Ongoing | Reward for referrals |

### Promotional Discount Guidelines

| Guideline | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| **Rare** | Frequency trains waiting |
| **Time-bound** | Creates urgency |
| **Reason-based** | Launch, milestone, not desperation |
| **Clear end date** | No ambiguity |
| **New customers only** (usually) | Protect existing revenue |

### Good Promotional Example

```
✓ Launch discount:
"We just launched AI features.
 First 500 customers get 25% off annual plans.
 Use code AILAUNCH at checkout.
 Offer ends Friday at midnight PT."

Clear: reason, limit, timeframe, how to redeem
```

### Bad Promotional Example

```
✗ Perpetual discount:
"Use code SAVE20 for 20% off! (running for 2 years)"
→ Not a real promotion, just a lower price

✗ Discount without reason:
"Big savings! 40% off this week!"
→ Why? Feels desperate

✗ Complicated redemption:
"Email sales@company.com with code SPECIALOFFER
 to schedule a call to discuss discount eligibility"
→ Too much friction
```

### Discount Ladder for Win-Back

| Time Since Churn | Offer |
|------------------|-------|
| **1-3 months** | "We miss you" + 20% off first month back |
| **3-6 months** | "Things have changed" + 30% off 3 months |
| **6-12 months** | "Here's what's new" + 50% off first 3 months |
| **12+ months** | Treat as new customer with acquisition offers |

### Discount Documentation

| Document | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| **Public pricing** | Standard discounts (annual, volume) |
| **Internal policy** | Approval matrix, discount limits |
| **Sales playbook** | When/how to offer, escalation |
| **Legal/finance** | Revenue recognition rules |

### Discount Approval Matrix

| Discount Level | Approver |
|----------------|----------|
| **0-10%** | Sales rep |
| **11-20%** | Sales manager |
| **21-30%** | VP Sales |
| **31%+** | C-level |
| **Custom terms** | Legal + Finance |

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Annual mix** | % of new revenue from annual |
| **Discount rate** | Average discount given |
| **Deal velocity** | Do discounts speed cycles? |
| **LTV by discount** | Does discounted revenue retain? |
| **Promo conversion** | Does promo traffic convert? |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Always-on discounts** — Trains customers to never pay full price
- **Discount without commitment** — Give discount, get nothing in return
- **Hidden annual requirement** — Price looks monthly but requires annual
- **No limit on negotiations** — Reps can give any discount
- **Ignoring LTV impact** — Heavily discounted customers may churn faster
- **Promotional addiction** — Every month has a "sale"
- **Inconsistent policies** — Different customers get wildly different deals
- **No graduation path** — Startup pricing forever
