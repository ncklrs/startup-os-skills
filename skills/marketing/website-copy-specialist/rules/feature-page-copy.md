## Feature Page Copy

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Feature pages bridge the gap between "this sounds interesting" and "I can see myself using this." They demonstrate capability while selling outcomes.

### Feature Page Structure

### The Benefit-First Principle

Always lead with the outcome, then explain the mechanism:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Benefit → Feature** | "Ship faster with automated testing" |
| **Feature → Benefit** | "Our automated testing helps you ship faster" |
| **Benefit only** | "Ship 3x faster" |

### Feature Headline Formulas

| Formula | Example | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **[Outcome] with [Feature]** | "Never miss a bug with automated testing" | Outcome clarity |
| **[Feature]: [Benefit]** | "Smart Alerts: Know before your customers do" | Feature recognition |
| **[Verb] your [Noun], [Qualifier]** | "Track your metrics, in real-time" | Action-oriented |
| **[Pain Point] solved** | "Context switching, solved" | Problem-aware visitors |
| **The [Noun] that [Differentiator]** | "The dashboard that updates itself" | Competitive diff |

### Good Feature Headlines

```
✓ "Reporting that writes itself"
  → Outcome-focused, implies ease

✓ "Real-time collaboration without the chaos"
  → Benefit + addresses concern

✓ "Find any file in milliseconds"
  → Specific, measurable outcome

✓ "Integrations that just work"
  → Addresses integration pain

✓ "Automated workflows: Set it and forget it"
  → Feature name + benefit summary
```

### Bad Feature Headlines

```
✗ "Reporting"
  → Zero value proposition

✗ "Advanced Analytics Dashboard v2.0"
  → Technical naming, no benefit

✗ "Powerful Collaboration Tools"
  → Generic, could be any product

✗ "Our Best Feature Yet"
  → Self-congratulatory, no information

✗ "Next-Gen Automation Engine"
  → Buzzwords without substance
```

### Writing Benefit Statements

Transform features into benefits using this structure:

| Feature | So What? | Benefit Statement |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| "99.9% uptime" | Users don't experience downtime | "Always available when you need it" |
| "256-bit encryption" | Data is secure | "Your data stays yours" |
| "Real-time sync" | Changes appear instantly | "See updates the moment they happen" |
| "30+ integrations" | Works with existing tools | "Connect your entire stack" |
| "Customizable dashboards" | See what matters to you | "Your data, your way" |

### Good Benefit Sections

```
✓ "Get answers in seconds, not hours"
   Your team stops waiting. With instant search across all your documents,
   the information you need is always one query away.

✓ "Never lose a conversation again"
   Every message, every thread, every decision — automatically saved and
   searchable. No more "Can you resend that?"

✓ "Scale without scaling your team"
   Automation handles the repetitive work. Handle 10x the volume with
   the same headcount.
```

### Bad Benefit Sections

```
✗ "Powerful Search Capabilities"
   Our search feature uses advanced algorithms to find your content.
   → Technical focus, no user benefit

✗ "Industry-Leading Technology"
   We've invested millions in our cutting-edge infrastructure.
   → About you, not about them

✗ "Robust and Scalable"
   Built on enterprise-grade architecture for maximum performance.
   → Jargon without meaning
```

### Capability vs. Benefit Matrix

| Don't Say (Capability) | Say This (Benefit) |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| "Custom fields" | "Track exactly what matters to you" |
| "API access" | "Build anything on top of our platform" |
| "Role-based permissions" | "Give everyone exactly the access they need" |
| "Audit logs" | "Know who did what, and when" |
| "SSO support" | "One login for your whole team" |
| "Webhooks" | "Get notified the moment things happen" |
| "Bulk actions" | "Update hundreds of records in seconds" |
| "Version history" | "Undo anything, recover everything" |

### How It Works Section

Use 3-5 steps maximum. Each step should be:
- **Titled with an action verb**
- **Described in one sentence**
- **Accompanied by a visual**

```
✓ Good "How It Works":

1. Connect your tools
   Link your existing apps in one click. We support 50+ integrations.
   [Screenshot of integration setup]

2. Set your rules
   Define what triggers automation and what happens next.
   [Screenshot of rule builder]

3. Watch it work
   Sit back as repetitive tasks handle themselves.
   [Screenshot of automation running]
```

```
✗ Bad "How It Works":

1. First, create an account and verify your email
2. Then navigate to settings and configure your preferences
3. Next, set up your first project by clicking the + button
4. After that, invite your team members
5. Now you can start using the platform
6. Don't forget to check out our documentation
   → Too many steps, too much detail, no visuals
```

### Use Case Formatting

```
✓ "Perfect for product teams who..."
   • Need to track feature requests across channels
   • Want to prioritize based on customer impact
   • Hate switching between tools

✓ "Built for engineering teams that..."
   • Deploy multiple times per day
   • Need visibility into what's shipping
   • Want to catch issues before users do
```

### Feature Page CTAs

| Feature Type | Primary CTA | Secondary CTA |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Core feature** | "Try it free" | "See it in action" |
| **Enterprise feature** | "Talk to sales" | "See pricing" |
| **Technical feature** | "Read the docs" | "Start building" |
| **New feature** | "Get early access" | "Learn more" |

### Social Proof for Feature Pages

| Proof Type | Example | Best For |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Metric** | "Teams save 5 hours/week with automation" | Quantifiable features |
| **Quote** | "Finally, reporting I actually use." — VP Engineering | Emotional features |
| **Logo** | "Used by teams at Stripe, Notion, Figma" | Trust features |
| **Case study link** | "How Acme reduced QA time by 60%" | Complex features |

### Feature Page Checklist

- [ ] Headline leads with benefit, not feature name
- [ ] Subheadline explains the "how" or adds specificity
- [ ] Hero visual shows the feature in action
- [ ] 3-5 key benefits with supporting detail
- [ ] "How it works" in 3-5 clear steps
- [ ] At least one testimonial or proof point
- [ ] CTA specific to this feature
- [ ] Cross-links to related features
- [ ] Mobile-optimized visuals and layout

### Anti-Patterns

- **Listing features without benefits** — "We have X" vs "You get Y"
- **Technical jargon** — Write for users, not engineers
- **Generic screenshots** — Show the feature in realistic use
- **Missing "so what"** — Every capability needs an outcome
- **Wall of text** — Scannable beats readable
- **No proof points** — Claims need evidence
- **Weak CTA** — "Learn more" is not a feature CTA
- **Feature isolation** — Show how it connects to other features
