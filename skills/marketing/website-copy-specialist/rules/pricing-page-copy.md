| **Outcome Focus** | "Start shipping faster today" | Action-oriented |
| **Anxiety Reduction** | "No surprises. No hidden fees." | Price-sensitive |

### Good Pricing Headlines

```

✓ "Simple pricing. Powerful features."
  → Sets expectation of clarity + value

✓ "Start free, upgrade when you're ready"
  → Low-commitment framing

✓ "The right plan for every team"
  → Inclusive, reduces "not for me" concern
```

### Bad Pricing Headlines

```
✗ "Pricing"
  → Missed opportunity for value framing

✗ "Our Premium Pricing Packages"
  → "Premium" sounds expensive

✗ "Investment Options for Your Business"
  → Corporate speak, feels salesy

✗ "World-Class Pricing for World-Class Results"
  → Empty hyperbole
```

### Tier Naming Strategy

| Naming Approach | Examples | Best For |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| **Audience-based** | Starter, Team, Enterprise | Clear targeting |
| **Value-based** | Basic, Pro, Premium | Perceived value |

  → Clear progression, familiar naming

✓ "Starter" → "Growth" → "Scale"
  → Journey-based, implies progression

✓ "Developer" → "Team" → "Organization"
  → Audience clarity
```

### Bad Tier Names

```
✗ "Bronze" → "Silver" → "Gold" → "Platinum"
  → Feels like credit cards, dated

✗ "Good" → "Better" → "Best"
  → Implies lower tiers are inadequate

✗ "Basic" → "Standard" → "Advanced" → "Premium" → "Ultimate"
  → Too many tiers, unclear differentiation
```

### Pricing FAQs That Convert

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "Can I change plans later?" | Reduces commitment anxiety |
| "What happens when my trial ends?" | Clarifies next steps |
| "Do you offer discounts for annual billing?" | Encourages longer commitment |
| "Is there a free tier?" | Addresses budget concerns |
| "What payment methods do you accept?" | Reduces checkout friction |
| "Can I cancel anytime?" | Removes risk |
| "Do you offer refunds?" | Builds trust |
| "What's included in the free trial?" | Clarifies trial value |
| "Do you offer nonprofit/education discounts?" | Expands audience |

### Good FAQ Answers

```
✓ Q: "Can I change plans later?"
   A: "Absolutely. Upgrade or downgrade anytime from your dashboard.
      If you upgrade, you'll be prorated for the remainder of your
      billing period. If you downgrade, the change takes effect at
      your next billing date."

✓ Q: "What happens when my trial ends?"
   A: "We'll send you a reminder 3 days before. If you don't add a
      payment method, you'll be moved to our free plan automatically.
      Your data stays safe either way."
```

### Bad FAQ Answers

```
✗ Q: "What's your refund policy?"
   A: "Please refer to our Terms of Service for detailed information
      regarding our refund policy and procedures."
   → Creates friction, feels defensive

✗ Q: "Can I cancel anytime?"
   A: "Yes."
   → Missed opportunity to build trust

| **Price** | "Contact us" or "Custom pricing" |
| **Description** | List enterprise needs it serves |
| **Features** | Security, compliance, scale, support |

### Good Enterprise Section

   • SAML SSO & SCIM
   • SOC 2 Type II compliance
   • 99.99% SLA
   • Dedicated success manager
   • Custom integrations
   • Volume discounts

   [Talk to sales]

```

### Social Proof for Pricing Pages

| Type | Example | Placement |
|------|---------|-----------|

| **Value quote** | "Best investment we've made" | Below tiers |
| **Customer logos** | Tier-specific logos | Within tier cards |
| **Metric** | "Teams save 10+ hours/week" | Above tiers |

### Pricing Page CTAs

|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Free tier** | "Get started free" | — |
| **Paid tier (no trial)** | "Start [Tier Name]" | "Compare plans" |
| **Paid tier (with trial)** | "Start free trial" | "See a demo" |
| **Enterprise** | "Talk to sales" | "Book a demo" |

### Friction Reducers

| Objection | Friction Reducer |
|-----------|------------------|
| "What if it doesn't work for us?" | "14-day free trial" |
| "What if we need to cancel?" | "Cancel anytime" |
| "Is this secure?" | "SOC 2 compliant" badge |
| "Will we get help?" | "24/7 support included" |
| "What about credit card?" | "No credit card required" |
| "Is this the best price?" | "Save 20% with annual" |

### Pricing Page Checklist

- [ ] Headline frames value, not just "Pricing"
- [ ] 2-4 clearly differentiated tiers
- [ ] Recommended tier is visually highlighted
- [ ] Each tier has a clear audience description
- [ ] Feature comparison is scannable
- [ ] FAQ addresses top objections
- [ ] Social proof focused on value/ROI
- [ ] Enterprise option with clear CTA
- [ ] Friction reducers visible (trial, cancel policy)
- [ ] Mobile-optimized tier display

### Anti-Patterns

- **Hidden pricing** — If you hide it, people assume the worst
- **Too many tiers** — 3-4 is ideal, more creates confusion
- **Feature overload** — Highlight differences, not everything
- **Jargon in features** — "SSO" needs explanation for some audiences
- **Buried enterprise option** — Make it easy to find for large buyers
- **No social proof** — Pricing pages need trust signals
- **Vague enterprise tier** — "Contact us" with no features listed
- **Missing FAQ** — Unanswered questions = lost conversions
- **No recommended tier** — Help people choose
- **Complex pricing math** — Per user + per seat + usage = confusion
