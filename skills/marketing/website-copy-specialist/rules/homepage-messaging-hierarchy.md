## Homepage Messaging Hierarchy

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Your homepage has 3-5 seconds to answer: "What is this, and is it for me?" The messaging hierarchy determines whether visitors explore or bounce.

### The Hero Section Formula

| Element | Purpose | Character Limit |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Headline** | What you do + for whom | 6-12 words |
| **Subheadline** | How you do it + key benefit | 15-25 words |
| **Primary CTA** | Main desired action | 2-5 words |
| **Secondary CTA** | Lower-commitment option | 2-5 words |
| **Social proof** | Immediate credibility | Logos or single stat |

### Headline Formulas That Work

| Formula | Example | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **[Outcome] for [Audience]** | "Faster deploys for engineering teams" | Clear audience |
| **[Verb] your [Noun]** | "Automate your infrastructure" | Action-oriented |
| **The [Category] that [Differentiator]** | "The CRM that sells itself" | Competitive markets |
| **[Pain Point] is over** | "Manual QA is over" | Problem-aware audiences |
| **[Number] [Benefit]** | "10x faster code reviews" | Quantifiable outcomes |
| **Stop [Pain], Start [Gain]** | "Stop chasing leads, start closing deals" | Transformation |

### Good Homepage Headlines

```
✓ "Ship code without breaking things"
  → Clear outcome, implies audience (developers)

✓ "Customer support that scales with you"
  → Benefit + addresses growth concern

✓ "Turn customer feedback into product roadmap"
  → Input → Output transformation

✓ "The analytics platform built for product teams"
  → Category + specific audience

✓ "Contracts signed in minutes, not weeks"
  → Before/after with specificity
```

### Bad Homepage Headlines

```
✗ "Welcome to Acme Inc."
  → Zero information about what you do

✗ "Next-Generation Enterprise Solutions"
  → Meaningless buzzwords

✗ "We're changing the way teams work"
  → Vague, self-focused

✗ "The Future of [Industry]"
  → Grandiose, unsubstantiated

✗ "Powerful. Simple. Fast."
  → Adjectives without context
```

### Subheadline Best Practices

The subheadline expands on the headline with specificity:

| If headline is... | Subheadline should... |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Outcome-focused | Explain the mechanism |
| Audience-focused | State the benefit |
| Problem-focused | Introduce the solution |
| Bold claim | Provide proof or context |

### Good Subheadlines

```
Headline: "Ship code without breaking things"
✓ Subhead: "Automated testing that catches bugs before your customers do.
   Set up in 5 minutes, integrates with your CI/CD pipeline."
   → Explains how, adds speed + ease proof

Headline: "Customer support that scales with you"
✓ Subhead: "AI-powered ticketing that resolves 40% of requests automatically
   while keeping your human touch."
   → Mechanism + specific metric + addresses concern
```

### Bad Subheadlines

```
✗ "We're on a mission to help teams succeed"
  → Vague, doesn't expand on headline

✗ "Learn more about our innovative platform"
  → Says nothing, wastes prime real estate

✗ "Trusted by thousands of companies worldwide"
  → Better as social proof, not subhead
```

### CTA Hierarchy

| CTA Type | Examples | When to Use |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **High commitment** | "Start free trial", "Buy now" | Product-aware visitors |
| **Medium commitment** | "See demo", "Get a quote" | Solution-aware visitors |
| **Low commitment** | "See how it works", "Explore features" | Problem-aware visitors |

### Good CTA Combinations

```
✓ Primary: "Start free trial"
  Secondary: "See it in action"
  → Clear path for ready + curious visitors

✓ Primary: "Get started free"
  Secondary: "Talk to sales"
  → Self-serve + enterprise paths

✓ Primary: "Book a demo"
  Secondary: "Watch 2-min overview"
  → Qualified path + quick preview
```

### Bad CTA Combinations

```
✗ Primary: "Learn more"
  Secondary: "Contact us"
  → Both vague, no clear hierarchy

✗ Primary: "Start trial"
  Secondary: "Start trial"
  → No alternative path

✗ Three equal CTAs
  → Choice paralysis, no clear direction
```

### Social Proof Placement

| Location | Type | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Hero (below CTA)** | Logo bar or single stat | Immediate credibility |
| **After problem/solution** | Testimonial quote | Validates the pain |
| **After features** | Case study snippet | Proves capabilities |
| **Before final CTA** | Multiple testimonials | Overcomes last objections |

### Above-the-Fold Checklist

- [ ] Headline answers "What is this?"
- [ ] Subheadline explains the "how" or "why"
- [ ] Primary CTA is specific and action-oriented
- [ ] Secondary CTA offers alternative path
- [ ] Social proof element visible (logos or stat)
- [ ] No competing navigation distractions
- [ ] Mobile: CTA visible without scrolling

### Homepage Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Bounce rate** | <50% | Messaging relevance |
| **Scroll depth** | >60% to CTA | Content engagement |
| **CTA click rate** | >5% | Value prop clarity |
| **Time on page** | 1-3 min | Content quality |

### Anti-Patterns

- **"We" focus** — Homepage is about the visitor, not you
- **Feature list as hero** — Lead with outcomes, not capabilities
- **Jargon in headlines** — "AI-powered synergistic solutions" means nothing
- **No clear CTA** — Every homepage needs one primary action
- **Competing messages** — One value prop, not five
- **Buried differentiation** — If you're different, say it above the fold
- **Missing social proof** — Claims without credibility
- **Navigation overload** — Too many choices = no choice
