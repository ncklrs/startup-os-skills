# Marketing Strategist

Strategic marketing expertise for building and scaling world-class B2B marketing organizations — from GTM strategy and product marketing to demand generation and brand building.

## Philosophy

Marketing is not a cost center. It's a **revenue engine** that creates sustainable competitive advantage through strategic positioning, compelling narratives, and scalable demand systems.

The best marketing organizations:
1. **Lead with strategy** — Tactics without strategy is noise
2. **Own the narrative** — Category creation beats competition
3. **Measure what matters** — Pipeline and revenue, not vanity metrics
4. **Scale systematically** — Playbooks enable growth, not heroics
