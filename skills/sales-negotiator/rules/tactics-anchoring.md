## Anchoring & Framing Techniques

**Impact: HIGH**

The first number spoken shapes the entire negotiation. Anchor strategically, frame deliberately, and control the narrative.

### The Science of Anchoring

```
Anchoring Effect:
First number mentioned becomes a reference point.
All subsequent numbers are evaluated relative to it.

Even RANDOM anchors influence negotiations.
Strategic anchors influence them dramatically.
```

### Anchor Positioning Strategy

| Your Position | Anchor Strategy |
|---------------|-----------------|
| First mover | Anchor high, backed by rationale |
| Responder | Re-anchor or deflect before counteroffering |
| Unknown value | Gather info first, then anchor |

### Good Anchoring Examples

```
Scenario: Pricing a $100K software deal

Strong anchor approach:
"Based on the scope we discussed, similar implementations have
ranged from $180,000 to $220,000. Given your specific needs and
timeline, I'd recommend our Professional tier at $150,000."

Breakdown:
- Range anchor ($180K-$220K) sets high expectation
- Social proof (similar implementations)
- Your number ($150K) feels reasonable by comparison
- Leaves room for negotiation while protecting value
```

```
Scenario: Enterprise deal with unknown budget

Information-gathering approach:
"Before we discuss investment levels, help me understand - what
have you allocated for this initiative? I want to make sure we're
exploring options that fit your planning."

Then anchor:
"Thanks for sharing. Companies investing at that level typically
see results from our Growth tier, which starts at [higher than
their number]. Here's how we could potentially bridge the gap..."
```

### Bad Anchoring Examples

```
Scenario: Buyer asks for price first

Weak response:
"Our pricing starts at $50,000."
(Anchored low, nowhere to go but down)

Better response:
"Pricing depends on scope, but our enterprise implementations
typically range from $100,000 to $250,000. Let's discuss your
needs to see where you'd fit."
(Anchored high with range, room to adjust)
```

```
Scenario: Responding to low anchor

Weak response:
"Well, $30,000 is below our cost, but we could maybe do $45,000?"
(Accepted their anchor, negotiated against yourself)

Better response:
"I understand budget constraints. To set expectations, companies
with your requirements invest between $80,000 and $120,000 with us.
Let's talk about what's driving your number and see if there's a
path forward."
(Re-anchored, seeking to understand)
```

### Framing Techniques

**How you say it matters as much as what you say:**

| Frame Type | Example | Psychology |
|------------|---------|------------|
| **Loss frame** | "Without this, you'll continue losing $50K/month" | Loss aversion |
| **Gain frame** | "This will generate $50K/month in savings" | Positive motivation |
| **Exclusive** | "This pricing is for design partners only" | Scarcity, status |
| **Investment** | "Your investment of $100K" vs "The cost is $100K" | Ownership mindset |
| **Per-unit** | "$8/user/month" vs "$96K annual" | Digestible numbers |

### Framing in Practice

```
Scenario: Presenting price

Cost framing (weak):
"The annual cost is $120,000."

Investment framing (strong):
"Your annual investment of $120,000 - which breaks down to
roughly $10,000 per month - protects $2M in revenue risk.
That's about 6% of the value you're protecting."

ROI framing (strongest):
"For every dollar you invest, you're protecting $17 in revenue.
Companies typically see payback within 3 months."
```

```
Scenario: Discount request response

Weak frame:
"I can give you 15% off."
(You gave, they took)

Strong frame:
"I can restructure this to reduce your investment by 15% if we
move to annual payment and a 2-year commitment. That reduces
our risk, which lets us pass savings to you."
(Value exchange, mutual benefit)
```

### Counter-Anchoring Strategies

**When they anchor first:**

1. **Acknowledge, don't accept**
   "I hear you. Let me share some context before we discuss numbers."

2. **Re-anchor with rationale**
   "Based on market rates and the value delivered, similar solutions
   range from X to Y."

3. **Question their anchor**
   "Help me understand how you arrived at that number. What's it based on?"

4. **Bracket with range**
   "That's quite a bit below where we typically engage. Our range
   for this scope is X to Y."

### Price Presentation Tactics

| Tactic | How It Works | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Contrast pricing** | Show expensive option first | Enterprise ($300K), Growth ($150K), Starter ($75K) |
| **Decoy pricing** | Make target option look best | Growth ($150K) vs Growth+ ($145K with fewer features) |
| **Bundle pricing** | Combine to obscure line items | "Complete solution: $200K" vs itemized |
| **Unbundle pricing** | Show components to justify total | "Platform ($100K) + Integration ($50K) + Training ($20K)" |

### Anchoring Power Dynamics

```
High anchor works when:
- You have strong BATNA
- Product is differentiated
- Buyer has limited alternatives
- Value is well-established

Low anchor works when:
- You want to close fast
- Land-and-expand strategy
- Building reference customers
- Volume/scale opportunity
```

### The "That's Expensive" Response

```
Buyer: "That's expensive."

Bad response:
"Where do we need to be?" (Negotiating against yourself)

Good responses:

1. Compared to what?
"Expensive compared to what? I want to understand your reference point."

2. Value probe
"What would make it worth that investment to you?"

3. Reframe
"It's a significant investment. The question is whether the
outcome is worth it. Let's talk about what success looks like."

4. Acknowledge and explore
"It's definitely an investment. Companies typically find the
cost of not solving this is 3-4x higher. What's it costing
you today?"
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Anchoring without rationale** — Numbers without justification feel arbitrary
- **Accepting their anchor** — Starting from their number instead of yours
- **Revealing your floor** — "Our absolute minimum is..."
- **Price before value** — Discussing investment before establishing worth
- **Single price point** — Not using range or tiered options
- **Apologetic pricing** — "I know it's a lot, but..."
