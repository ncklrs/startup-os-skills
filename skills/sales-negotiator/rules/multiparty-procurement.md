## Procurement & Legal Negotiations

**Impact: HIGH**

Your champion wants you to win. Procurement wants to win for the company. Legal wants to avoid risk. Navigate all three to close enterprise deals.

### Procurement Negotiation Tactics

**Common procurement moves and responses:**

| Their Tactic | What They Want | Your Response |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| "We have budget for $X" | Anchor low | "That's helpful context. Let me show you what's possible at different investment levels." |
| "We need 3 competitive bids" | Process compliance | "Absolutely. Happy to participate. What criteria matter most?" |
| "Your competitor is cheaper" | Price pressure | "What specifically are you comparing? Let's look at total value." |
| "Take it or leave it" | Test your floor | "I understand. Let me take this back internally. We may need to adjust scope." |
| "Add these terms at same price" | Scope creep | "Those add value. Here's how that affects the investment level." |

### Legal Negotiation Common Issues

| Clause | Their Concern | Your Position | Resolution Path |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Liability cap** | Unlimited exposure | Cap at contract value | 2-3x annual contract value |
| **Indemnification** | Third-party claims | Mutual, limited | Carve out willful misconduct |
| **IP ownership** | Work product rights | You retain platform IP | They own their data, configs |
| **Data privacy** | Compliance (GDPR, etc.) | Standard DPA | Offer DPA addendum |
| **Termination** | Trapped in bad contract | Lock-in period | Allow with notice, no refund |
| **SLA penalties** | Accountability | Reasonable targets | Credit, not cash penalties |
| **Security requirements** | Breach prevention | SOC 2, standard | Provide documentation |

### Good Multi-Party Navigation Examples

```
Scenario: Procurement joins late, demands 25% discount

Bad approach:
Negotiate directly with procurement, bypass champion.
(Champion feels cut out, loses face)

Good approach:
"Thanks for joining the conversation. [Champion] and I have
been working on scoping this for your needs. I'd love to
understand your process and what success looks like for you.
[Champion], can you share the business case we developed?"

Then: Let champion justify the value. Address procurement
concerns. Trade for any additional discount.
```

```
Scenario: Legal redlines 15 contract terms

Bad approach:
Accept all changes to avoid delay.
(Sets terrible precedent, may create operational issues)

Good approach:
"I've reviewed your redlines. I can accept items 1, 3, 7, 9,
and 12 as written. Items 2, 5, and 11 we can meet halfway -
here's our proposed language. Items 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14, and
15 are standard terms we can't modify, but let me explain
the rationale and why they protect both parties."
```

### The Champion Enablement Model

```
Don't replace your champion. Enable them.

What champions need from you:
- Business case documentation they can share
- ROI calculations in their company's format
- Competitive comparisons for procurement
- Security/compliance documentation for IT
- Executive summary for their leadership
- Answers to questions before they're asked
```

### Procurement Process Navigation

| Stage | What Happens | Your Focus |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **RFI** | Information gathering | Stand out, get disqualified |
| **RFP** | Formal requirements | Shape criteria, compliance |
| **Vendor calls** | Dog and pony shows | Differentiate, build relationships |
| **Shortlist** | Final 2-3 vendors | Understand decision criteria |
| **BAFO** | Best and final offer | Strategic pricing, protect value |
| **Contract** | Legal negotiation | Expedite, don't cave |
| **Approval** | Internal sign-offs | Support champion |

### Handling Multi-Party Conflict

```
Scenario: Champion wants features, CFO wants low price

Your move:
"It sounds like there's a tradeoff between capability and
investment. Let me propose two options that might help:

Option A: Full scope at $150K with [all features champion wants]
Option B: Core scope at $100K with [essentials], expandable later

What would help your internal discussion?"

Why it works:
- You're not choosing sides
- You're providing options that serve both
- Champion keeps their priorities on the table
- CFO has a budget-friendly option
- You're guiding, not dictating
```

### Legal Redline Response Framework

**For each requested change:**

1. **Understand intent** — What risk are they addressing?
2. **Assess impact** — Can you operationally comply?
3. **Categorize response:**
   - Accept as-is
   - Accept with modification
   - Reject with explanation
   - Trade for something else

**Response template:**
```
"Regarding [clause], I understand you're concerned about [their
interest]. Here's what we can do: [your proposal]. This protects
your interest in [X] while allowing us to [Y]. Would that work?"
```

### Expediting Procurement/Legal

| Tactic | How It Works |
|--------|-------------|
| Provide comparables | "Here are similar agreements we've signed" |
| Offer paper choice | "Happy to use your paper if faster" |
| Pre-answer objections | Include FAQ with standard terms |
| Single-thread legal | "Can we set up a call to resolve these together?" |
| Create urgency (real) | "Implementation team available next month only" |
| Executive alignment | Have your exec reach out to their exec |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Ignoring procurement** — Hoping champion can bypass them
- **Legal as enemy** — Treating every redline as adversarial
- **Single threading** — Only talking to your champion
- **Scope creep acceptance** — Adding requirements without price adjustment
- **Over-conceding to close** — Accepting terms that hurt you operationally
- **Bypassing process** — Trying to skip steps (it backfires)
- **Champion abandonment** — Going around them when things get hard
