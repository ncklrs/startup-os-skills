# Sales Negotiator

Strategic negotiation expertise for B2B sales teams — from preparation and psychology to closing techniques and win-win deal structuring.

## Philosophy

Great negotiation isn't about winning. It's about **creating value** that makes agreement inevitable.

The best B2B negotiators:
1. **Prepare obsessively** — The negotiation is won before it begins
2. **Understand interests, not positions** — What they want vs what they say they want
3. **Expand the pie before dividing** — Find value neither side saw initially
4. **Walk away when necessary** — A bad deal is worse than no deal

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `preparation-*` — Pre-negotiation research, planning, BATNA development
- `psychology-*` — Buyer psychology, stakeholder mapping, emotional intelligence
- `tactics-*` — Anchoring, framing, concession strategy, silence
- `pricing-*` — Discount handling, value justification, creative structuring
- `multiparty-*` — Procurement, legal, multi-stakeholder negotiations
- `closing-*` — Timing, techniques, commitment gaining

## Core Frameworks

### Negotiation Phases

| Phase | Activities | Key Focus |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Preparation** | Research, BATNA, objectives, limits | Know more than they do |
| **Opening** | Anchor, frame, set expectations | Control the narrative |
| **Exploration** | Questions, listening, interest discovery | Understand their world |
| **Bargaining** | Concessions, trades, package building | Create and claim value |
| **Closing** | Commitment, documentation, next steps | Lock in the win-win |

### The BATNA Hierarchy

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  Walk Away      │  ← Your power base
                    │  (Best Alternative)
                    ├─────────────────┤
                    │  Resistance     │  ← Fight hard here
                    │  Point          │
                    ├─────────────────┤
                    │  Target         │  ← Aim here
                    │  Outcome        │
                    ├─────────────────┤
                    │  Aspiration     │  ← Start here
                    │  (Anchor)       │
                    └─────────────────┘
```

### Value Creation Model

- **Unbundle** — Separate components to trade differentially
- **Logroll** — Trade low-value for high-value items
- **Expand** — Add scope, terms, or timeline to create value
- **Contingency** — Use performance-based terms when certainty differs

### Stakeholder Power Map

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           DECISION DYNAMICS             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Economic Buyer (signs check)           │
│  ┌─────────┐                            │
│  │   CFO   │ ← Money authority          │
│  └─────────┘                            │
│  Technical Buyer (says it works)        │
│  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐               │
│  │   IT    │  │  Eng    │ ← Veto power  │
│  └─────────┘  └─────────┘               │
│  User Buyer (uses it daily)             │
│  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐               │
│  │  Ops    │  │ Support │ ← Political   │
│  └─────────┘  └─────────┘     capital   │
│  Champion (sells internally)            │
│  ┌─────────┐                            │
│  │  Your   │ ← Must enable, not replace │
│  │  Ally   │                            │
│  └─────────┘                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Negotiation Styles

| Style | When to Use | Risk |
|-------|------------|------|
| **Collaborative** | Long-term relationship, complex deals | May leave value on table |
| **Competitive** | One-time transaction, commodity | Damages relationship |
| **Compromising** | Time pressure, equal power | Suboptimal for both |
| **Accommodating** | Relationship > outcome, minor issue | Sets bad precedent |
| **Avoiding** | Losing battle, need time | May miss windows |

## Concession Patterns

### The Diminishing Concession Pattern

```
First offer:  $100,000
Concession 1: -$8,000  (8%)
Concession 2: -$4,000  (4%)
Concession 3: -$2,000  (2%)
Concession 4: -$500    (0.5%)
Final:        $85,500

Signal: "We're approaching our limit"
```

### The Package Trade Pattern

```
Instead of:
  "I'll give you 10% off"

Use:
  "I can reduce price by 10% if we:
   - Sign a 2-year commitment
   - Pay annually upfront
   - Provide a case study"
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Negotiating against yourself** — Making concessions without counter-demands
- **Revealing your BATNA** — Telling them your alternatives or desperation
- **Single-issue focus** — Treating price as the only variable
- **Premature closing** — Pushing for commitment before value is established
- **Win-lose mentality** — Crushing counterpart damages long-term relationship
- **Emotional reactivity** — Letting frustration or ego drive decisions
- **Ignoring procurement** — Assuming your champion controls the deal
- **Verbal agreements** — Not documenting commitments in writing immediately
