## Concession Strategy & Trading

**Impact: HIGH**

Every concession sends a signal. Strategic concessions build momentum toward agreement. Random concessions train buyers to ask for more.

### The Golden Rule of Concessions

```
NEVER give without getting.

Bad:  "I'll give you 10% off."
Good: "I'll give you 10% off if you sign by Friday."

The trade creates:
- Reciprocity (they feel obligated)
- Value perception (if free, it's worthless)
- Momentum (mutual movement)
- Signal (you're at your limit)
```

### Concession Value Matrix

**Know what to trade:**

| Your Concession | Cost to You | Value to Them | Trade Grade |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Case study rights | Low | Low | C (use as sweetener) |
| Extended payment terms | Medium | High | A (great trade) |
| Additional training | Low | Medium | B (easy value add) |
| 5% discount | High | Medium | C (protect this) |
| Multi-year pricing lock | Medium | High | A (get commitment) |
| Free implementation | High | High | B (trade for multi-year) |
| Dedicated CSM | Medium | Medium | B (good for expansion) |
| SLA upgrade | Low | Medium | A (costs little) |
| Contract flexibility | Low | High | A (great trade) |

### Concession Patterns

**The Diminishing Pattern:**
```
Each concession should be smaller than the last.

Concession 1:  $10,000  (large, shows goodwill)
Concession 2:  $5,000   (50% of first)
Concession 3:  $2,000   (smaller still)
Concession 4:  $500     (tiny, signaling floor)
Final offer:   $250     (token gesture)

Message: "We're running out of room"
```

**The Reluctant Pattern:**
```
Take time before each concession.

"Let me think about that..."
[Pause]
"This is difficult, but here's what I can do..."

Why: Easy concessions signal more room exists
```

**The Package Pattern:**
```
Trade multiple items at once.

"Here's what I can do as a package:
- 10% discount
- 60-day payment terms
- Premium support tier

In exchange for:
- 3-year commitment
- Annual upfront payment
- Reference call participation

This only works as a complete package."

Why: Prevents cherry-picking
```

### Good Concession Examples

```
Scenario: They want 15% off

Bad approach:
"Let me check... okay, I can do 15%."
(Instant, free, signals more room)

Good approach:
"15% is a significant ask. Let me be straight with you -
I can get there, but here's what would make that work on
our end: annual payment instead of monthly, and a 2-year
minimum commitment. That helps me justify it internally.
Would those work for you?"

(Traded, reluctant, explained why)
```

```
Scenario: They want faster implementation

Bad approach:
"Sure, we can expedite that."
(Gave away value, set expectation)

Good approach:
"Standard implementation is 8 weeks, which lets us do it
right. We can accelerate to 4 weeks—we'd bring in additional
resources. There's a $15K expedite fee for that. Given your
timeline, would that make sense?"

(Value for value, or scope their urgency)
```

### Bad Concession Examples

```
Scenario: Sequential concessions

Buyer: "Can you do better on price?"
You: "I can do 5% off."
Buyer: "That's not enough."
You: "Okay, 10%."
Buyer: "Still need more."
You: "Fine, 15%."

What happened:
- You negotiated against yourself
- They learned asking = getting
- You showed no limit exists
- They'll push for 20%
```

```
Scenario: Unreciprocated concession

You: "To help move this forward, I'll include premium support
at no charge and extend your payment terms to net-60."

Buyer: "Great, thanks. Now about that discount..."

What happened:
- You gave two concessions unprompted
- Got nothing in return
- Set precedent that asking isn't required
- Still facing original request
```

### The Concession Conversation

**Structure for any trade:**

```
1. Acknowledge their request
   "I hear you. Price flexibility is important."

2. Express difficulty (genuinely)
   "That's a significant ask for us."

3. Propose a trade
   "Here's what I can do: [your concession] if [their trade]."

4. Explain the why
   "That works because [mutual benefit]."

5. Confirm the package
   "Does that work as a complete package?"
```

### What to Never Concede

| Never Trade | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Unlimited liability | Legal nightmare |
| Custom development (free) | Scope creep, expectation setting |
| Price without trade | Trains bad behavior |
| "Most Favored Nation" | Constrains future deals |
| Perpetual license at subscription price | Destroys model |
| Commitments you can't keep | Trust destruction |

### Managing Concession Pressure

**When they push hard:**

```
"You've got to do better than that."

Response options:

1. The walk-back
"I understand the pressure. I've already moved significantly.
If this doesn't work, we may need to look at different scope."

2. The why
"Help me understand what's driving this. Is it budget, or
do you not see the value at this level?"

3. The swap
"I don't have more room on price, but I could [alternative
trade]. Would that help?"

4. The pause
"Let me sit with this. I want to see if there's a creative
solution, but I need to think it through."
```

### The Final Concession

**Make your last concession count:**

```
"I want to get this done. Here's my absolute best:
[final offer]. This is everything I have authority for.
I can't go back to the well again. If this works, we're
partners. If not, I understand, and maybe timing isn't right."

Why it works:
- Clear finality
- Personal commitment
- No door for more
- Graceful exit if needed
```

### Tracking Concessions

**Keep a running log:**

| Item | Original | Concession | Trade Received |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|
| Price | $100K | $92K (-8%) | 2-year term |
| Payment | Net-30 | Net-45 | Upfront annual |
| Support | Standard | Premium | Case study |
| Training | 5 seats | 10 seats | Reference calls |

**Use the log to:**
- Show total concession value
- Prevent additional asks
- Document what was traded
- Inform future negotiations

### Anti-Patterns

- **Conceding without trade** — Free concessions have no perceived value
- **Fast concessions** — Speed signals more room
- **Large jumps** — Big moves signal you were inflated
- **Reactive conceding** — Conceding every time they push
- **Unlimited concessions** — No clear bottom
- **Verbal-only concessions** — Not documenting trades
- **Conceding on principle issues** — Trading on things that matter
