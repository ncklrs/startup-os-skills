## Value-Based Deal Structuring

**Impact: HIGH**

Price is just one variable. Creative deal structuring expands the pie, aligns incentives, and creates agreements neither side could reach with price alone.

### The Value Equation

```
Customer Value = (Benefits Received - Price Paid) × Confidence

Your job:
1. Maximize benefits perceived
2. Justify price relative to benefits
3. Increase confidence in outcomes

When Value Equation is positive, price becomes secondary.
```

### Deal Structure Components

| Component | Options | Trade Value |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Price** | Fixed, tiered, usage-based | High |
| **Term length** | 1-year, multi-year, month-to-month | Medium-High |
| **Payment timing** | Upfront, monthly, quarterly, milestone | Medium |
| **Scope** | Full, phased, pilot | Medium |
| **Services** | Included, a la carte, premium | Medium |
| **SLA/guarantees** | Standard, premium, custom | Low-Medium |
| **Expansion terms** | Locked rate, discount on growth | Medium |
| **Exit terms** | Notice period, cancellation rights | Low-Medium |

### Creative Structure Examples

**Structure 1: Phased Commitment**
```
Challenge: Buyer wants lower price, you want multi-year

Structure:
Year 1: $80K (20% discount) - prove value
Year 2: $90K (10% discount) - locked if Y1 succeeds
Year 3+: $100K (full price) - committed at Y1 signing

Why it works:
- Buyer gets reduced risk (low Y1 price)
- You get committed pipeline (multi-year)
- Expansion is built-in
```

**Structure 2: Success-Based Pricing**
```
Challenge: Buyer skeptical of ROI claims

Structure:
Base price: $60K (reduced)
Performance bonus: $40K if [metric] achieved in 6 months
Total potential: $100K

Why it works:
- Buyer pays less if value isn't delivered
- You earn more if you deliver
- Aligns incentives, builds trust
```

**Structure 3: Volume Commitment**
```
Challenge: Large enterprise wants deep discount

Structure:
Current need: 500 seats @ $100/seat = $50K
Committed volume: 2,000 seats @ $75/seat = $150K
True-up quarterly at committed rate

Why it works:
- Buyer gets lower per-unit cost
- You get guaranteed volume
- Growth is pre-sold
```

### Value Justification Framework

**Connect price to outcomes:**

```
Step 1: Quantify the problem
"You mentioned [problem] is costing you $X/month."

Step 2: Show the delta
"Our solution reduces that by Y%."

Step 3: Calculate value
"That's $Z/year in savings."

Step 4: Position price
"Your investment of $A delivers $Z return."

Step 5: Simple math
"That's a [X:1] ROI. For every dollar invested, you get $X back."
```

### Good Value Structuring Examples

```
Scenario: Startup with limited budget but high potential

Bad structure:
$100K annual contract (too big for their stage)

Good structure:
"Let's do this: $40K year one for core platform. If you hit
[growth milestone], you're already committed to our Growth tier
at $80K with preferred pricing locked for 3 years. We grow
with you, and you get below-market rates as you scale."

Why it works:
- Accessible entry point
- Built-in expansion
- Customer incentive to grow
- You capture the upside
```

```
Scenario: Enterprise buyer wants guarantees

Bad structure:
Discount to win deal (margin erosion)

Good structure:
"Instead of reducing price, let me offer this: standard pricing,
but with a performance guarantee. If you don't see [specific
metric] improvement in 90 days, we'll credit 50% of your first
quarter toward renewal or cancellation. We're that confident."

Why it works:
- Maintains price integrity
- Reduces buyer risk
- Demonstrates confidence
- Rarely invoked if product delivers
```

### Pricing Structures Comparison

| Model | Best For | Risk Distribution |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Fixed price** | Clear scope, predictable use | Buyer bears volume risk |
| **Per-seat** | User-based products | Shared, scales with use |
| **Usage-based** | Variable consumption | Seller bears adoption risk |
| **Outcome-based** | ROI-dependent sales | Shared based on success |
| **Hybrid** | Complex, multi-component | Customized risk sharing |

### The "Land and Expand" Structure

```
Initial deal (Land):
- Smaller scope/team/tier
- Lower price point
- Faster approval
- Prove value quickly

Expansion path (Expand):
- Pre-negotiated rates for growth
- Defined expansion triggers
- Locked pricing tiers
- Built-in success metrics

Example:
"Start with 50 seats at $150/seat ($7,500). At 100+ seats,
rate drops to $125. At 250+, $100. We'll lock these rates
for 3 years from signing."
```

### Handling "Your Price Is Too High"

**Response framework:**

```
Step 1: Acknowledge
"I hear you. Let's make sure the investment makes sense."

Step 2: Reframe to value
"Let's look at what you're getting..."

Step 3: Calculate impact
"If this saves [X hours/week] at [$Y/hour], that's [$Z/year]."

Step 4: Position choice
"The question isn't whether $[price] is a lot—it is. The
question is whether the outcome is worth it."

Step 5: Offer structure
"If the upfront investment is the blocker, we could structure
differently. What would make this work for you?"
```

### Win-Win Structure Tests

**Check your structure against:**

| Test | Question |
|------|----------|
| **Value delivery** | Does this structure incentivize us to deliver? |
| **Customer success** | Is the customer set up to succeed? |
| **Expansion alignment** | Do we both benefit from growth? |
| **Risk balance** | Is risk appropriately shared? |
| **Simplicity** | Can we explain this in 30 seconds? |
| **Sustainability** | Would we do this deal again? |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Race to lowest price** — Competing only on price destroys value
- **Complex structures** — Confusing terms create friction and distrust
- **One-sided risk** — All risk on one party creates misalignment
- **No expansion path** — Leaving future value undefined
- **Outcome promises without data** — Guarantees you can't verify
- **Custom everything** — Operational nightmare, precedent danger
- **Verbal structures** — Complex terms not in writing
