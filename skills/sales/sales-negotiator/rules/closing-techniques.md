## Closing Techniques & Timing

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Closing isn't a moment—it's a process. The best closers read signals, build momentum, and make commitment feel like the natural next step.

### The Closing Mindset

```
Old thinking: "How do I get them to sign?"
New thinking: "Have we created enough value that signing is obvious?"

If you've done the work:
- Established clear value
- Addressed all concerns
- Aligned stakeholders
- Agreed on terms

...closing is just administrative.
```

### Reading Buying Signals

**Strong buying signals:**

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| "When can we start?" | They've mentally committed |
| "Who handles implementation?" | Planning for ownership |
| "Can we pilot with one team first?" | Reducing risk to say yes |
| Involving finance/procurement | Moving to purchase process |
| Asking for references (again) | Final validation |
| Discussing contract details | Assuming the sale |
| "What happens after we sign?" | Visualizing ownership |

**Warning signals:**

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| Going quiet | Concern they haven't raised |
| "We'll discuss internally" | No clear next step |
| Asking same questions repeatedly | Not convinced |
| Fewer stakeholders in meetings | Losing momentum |
| "We're not ready yet" | Undefined blockers |
| Ghosting your champion | Decision made (not in your favor) |

### Closing Techniques

**1. The Assumptive Close**
```
"Let's talk about implementation timing. Would a January start
work with your team's availability?"

Best when: Strong buying signals, relationship trust established
```

**2. The Summary Close**
```
"Let me make sure I have this right. You need [problem solved],
by [timeline], and we've agreed that [your solution] delivers
[specific outcomes]. The investment is [$X]. Have I missed
anything before we move forward?"

Best when: Complex deals, multiple stakeholders
```

**3. The Alternative Close**
```
"Would you prefer to start with the annual plan, or does the
three-year commitment with the additional discount work better
for your budget cycle?"

Best when: Decision made, finalizing structure
```

**4. The Timeline Close**
```
"Given your go-live target of March 1, we'd need to kick off
implementation by January 15. Working backward, that means
contract by January 5. Does that timeline work?"

Best when: Clear deadline exists, urgency is real
```

**5. The Concern Resolution Close**
```
"You mentioned security review was the final step. Now that
we've passed that, what else do you need to move forward?"

Best when: Known objections have been addressed
```

### Good Closing Examples

```
Scenario: Deal is stalled, unclear blockers

Bad approach:
"Hey, just checking in. Any update on the contract?"
(Passive, no value add)

Good approach:
"I wanted to share something relevant. [Similar company] just
launched with us and saw [specific result] in 30 days. I thought
of you because of your [similar goal]. Is there anything holding
things up I can help address?"

(Adds value, creates social proof, surfaces blockers)
```

```
Scenario: Verbal agreement, no signature

Bad approach:
"Can you sign this week? I have quarter-end pressure."
(Your problem, not theirs)

Good approach:
"You mentioned wanting to launch before Q2. To hit that, we'd
need to start implementation next week. I've blocked our
best implementation team for you—can we get the paperwork
finalized by Thursday to hold that slot?"

(Their timeline, mutual commitment, real constraint)
```

### Bad Closing Examples

```
Scenario: Premature close

Bad approach:
"So, ready to sign?" (After one demo)

Why it fails:
- Value not established
- Concerns not surfaced
- No stakeholder alignment
- Feels pushy, damages trust
```

```
Scenario: Weak close attempt

Bad approach:
"Let me know if you have any questions or want to move forward."

Why it fails:
- No commitment requested
- No next step defined
- Easy to ignore
- Shows lack of confidence
```

### The Commitment Ladder

```
Build commitment incrementally:

Level 1: Information commitment
"Can I send you a case study?"
↓
Level 2: Time commitment
"Can we schedule a deeper dive with your team?"
↓
Level 3: Stakeholder commitment
"Would it make sense to include your CFO?"
↓
Level 4: Process commitment
"Let's draft a mutual evaluation plan"
↓
Level 5: Resource commitment
"Can your team do a technical review?"
↓
Level 6: Business commitment
"Let's discuss terms and timeline"
↓
Level 7: Contract commitment
"Here's the agreement for review"
```

### Handling the Stalled Deal

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Champion goes quiet | Internal politics or priority shift | Reach out directly, offer to help |
| "We need more time" | Undefined concern | "What would help you feel ready?" |
| New stakeholders appear | Expanding buying center | Embrace, don't resist |
| Repeated delays | Not a priority | Qualify harder, consider walking |
| Price concerns resurface | Value not established | Return to business case |

### Creating Urgency (Ethically)

**Real constraints you can use:**
- Implementation team availability
- Price protection before increase
- Quarter-end processing time
- Product changes/version timing
- Their stated timeline/goals

**Never use:**
- Fake deadlines
- False scarcity
- Pressure tactics
- "My manager will never approve this again"

### The Final Ask

**When everything is aligned:**

```
"[Name], we've covered a lot of ground. You've validated the
approach with your team, the business case is strong, and
we've agreed on terms. Is there anything else you need before
we move forward with the agreement?"

[Listen]

If clear: "Great. I'll send the contract today. What's the
best way to get this through your process quickly?"

If concern: "Tell me more about that. What would address it?"
```

### Post-Agreement Actions

| Action | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| Send contract immediately | Momentum is perishable |
| Confirm receipt | Ensure right hands |
| Offer to walk through | Remove friction |
| Align on timeline | Set expectations |
| Introduce implementation | Build confidence |
| Thank the champion | They took a risk on you |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Premature closing** — Asking for commitment before value is clear
- **Passive follow-up** — "Just checking in" with no value add
- **Avoiding the ask** — Hoping they'll volunteer to buy
- **High-pressure tactics** — Creating fake urgency
- **Ignoring signals** — Missing obvious buying or warning signs
- **Single close attempt** — Giving up after one "not yet"
- **Post-signature neglect** — Disappearing after the deal closes
