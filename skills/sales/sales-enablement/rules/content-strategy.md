### Bad Content Examples

```markdown
PROBLEM: Generic, no specifics

"XYZ Corp loves our product. They saw great results
and would recommend us to anyone. Their team is
now more efficient and productive."

✗ No numbers
✗ No specific use case
✗ No believable quotes
✗ Could be about any product

---

PROBLEM: Too technical for audience

"By implementing our Kubernetes-native secret
injection mechanism with mTLS encryption and
HashiCorp Vault integration using the CSI
driver, the DevOps team reduced their MTTR..."

✗ Wrong audience (VP vs DevOps)
✗ Jargon overload
✗ Features not benefits
```

| **Pricing Docs** | RevOps | Per change | Immediately |
| **Competitive** | PMM | Monthly | When outdated |
| **Templates** | Enablement | Quarterly | When unused |
| **Legal/Security** | Legal | Annually | Never (archive) |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Content hoarding** — Marketing owns, sales can't access
- **No version control** — Multiple outdated versions floating around
- **Search dysfunction** — Can't find content, reps give up
- **No usage tracking** — Don't know what works
- **Customer approval gaps** — Using case studies without permission
- **One-way creation** — Marketing creates, never asks sales what's needed
- **Stale content** — Case studies from 3 years ago with departed customers
- **Feature sheets** — Specs without benefits or use cases
