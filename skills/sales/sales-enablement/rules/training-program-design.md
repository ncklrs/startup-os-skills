## Training Program Design

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Effective training programs change behavior, not just transfer knowledge. Design for application, not absorption.

### The ADDIE Framework for Sales Training

| Phase | Activities | Outputs |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Analyze** | Assess skill gaps, define objectives, understand audience | Needs analysis, learning objectives |
| **Design** | Outline curriculum, select methods, plan assessments | Program blueprint, content outline |
| **Develop** | Create content, build exercises, prepare facilitators | Training materials, facilitator guides |
| **Implement** | Deliver training, facilitate practice, provide support | Trained sellers, completion data |
| **Evaluate** | Measure outcomes, gather feedback, iterate | ROI metrics, improvement recommendations |

### Training Delivery Methods

| Method | Best For | Retention Rate | Cost | Scale |
|--------|----------|----------------|------|-------|
| **Instructor-Led (ILT)** | Complex skills, new hires | 5-10% (lecture) | High | Low |
| **Virtual Instructor-Led (VILT)** | Distributed teams, updates | 5-10% | Medium | Medium |
| **E-Learning** | Foundational knowledge, compliance | 10-15% | Low | High |
| **Role-Play** | Skill practice, objection handling | 75% | Medium | Low |
| **On-the-Job** | Real application, deal coaching | 90% | Low | Medium |
| **Peer Learning** | Best practices, tribal knowledge | 50% | Low | Medium |
| **Microlearning** | Reinforcement, just-in-time | 20-25% | Low | High |

### Good Training Design

```markdown
EXAMPLE: Discovery Call Training Program

OBJECTIVES (Measurable):
- Sellers execute discovery framework with 80%+ adherence
- Average qualification score improves from 65 to 80
- Discovery call-to-demo conversion increases 15%

MODULE STRUCTURE:
1. Why Discovery Matters (15 min e-learning)
   - Business impact of poor discovery
   - What great looks like

2. The MEDDIC Framework Deep-Dive (60 min VILT)
   - Each element explained with examples
   - Live demonstration by top performer

3. Discovery Question Bank (Self-paced)
   - Industry-specific questions
   - Pain-point exploration techniques

4. Role-Play Certification (90 min workshop)
   - Paired practice with feedback rubric
   - Manager observation and coaching

5. Call Recording Analysis (Ongoing)
   - Weekly review of real calls
   - Peer feedback sessions

REINFORCEMENT:
- Weekly discovery tip (microlearning)
- Monthly call calibration sessions
- Quarterly skills refresher

MEASUREMENT:
- Pre/post knowledge assessment
- Role-play certification scores
- Pipeline quality metrics
- Win rate by discovery score
```

### Bad Training Design

```markdown
EXAMPLE: Ineffective Discovery Training

"Discovery Training - 4 Hour Session"

Agenda:
- 9:00 - Welcome and introductions
- 9:30 - PowerPoint: What is discovery? (45 slides)
- 10:30 - Break
- 10:45 - More PowerPoint: MEDDIC overview
- 11:30 - Watch a demo call recording
- 12:00 - Q&A
- 12:30 - Done! Go sell!

PROBLEMS:
✗ No clear learning objectives
✗ Passive learning only (lectures)
✗ No practice or application
✗ No reinforcement plan
✗ No measurement strategy
✗ Death by PowerPoint
```

Without reinforcement, 80% of training content is forgotten within 30 days.

### Spaced Repetition Schedule

| Timing | Reinforcement Type | Duration | Focus |
|--------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| **Day 1** | Initial training | Full session | Core concepts |
| **Day 2** | Recap quiz | 5 min | Key takeaways |
| **Day 7** | Microlearning | 10 min | Application scenarios |
| **Day 14** | Practice exercise | 30 min | Skill application |
| **Day 30** | Coaching session | 15 min | Real-world application |
| **Day 60** | Certification | Variable | Validated competency |
| **Day 90** | Refresher | 15 min | Advanced concepts |

### Training Program Template

```markdown
## [Program Name]

### Overview
- **Duration:** [Total time commitment]
- **Audience:** [Who should attend]
- **Prerequisites:** [Required knowledge/skills]
- **Delivery:** [Methods used]

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this program, participants will be able to:
1. [Observable, measurable objective]
2. [Observable, measurable objective]
3. [Observable, measurable objective]

### Curriculum Outline
| Module | Topic | Format | Duration |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... |

### Assessment Strategy
- **Knowledge:** [How you'll test comprehension]
- **Skill:** [How you'll validate application]
- **Behavior:** [How you'll measure on-the-job change]

### Reinforcement Plan
- [Spaced learning activities]

### Success Metrics
- **Leading:** [Early indicators]
- **Lagging:** [Business outcomes]
```

### Adult Learning Principles (Andragogy)

| Principle | Implication | Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Self-direction** | Adults want control | Offer choices, self-paced options |
| **Experience** | They bring knowledge | Build on existing skills, share stories |
| **Relevance** | Must see immediate use | Connect to quota, real scenarios |
| **Problem-centered** | Focus on solving issues | Use case studies, real deals |
| **Internal motivation** | Career growth, mastery | Show advancement path |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Firehose training** — Dumping everything at once with no structure
- **Lecture-only** — No practice, role-play, or application
- **No reinforcement** — Training event with no follow-up
- **Measuring attendance** — Butts in seats ≠ behavior change
- **Generic content** — Same training for all roles and tenures
- **Training as punishment** — "Underperformers must attend"
- **No manager involvement** — Managers don't reinforce in 1:1s
- **Ignoring feedback** — Not iterating based on participant input
