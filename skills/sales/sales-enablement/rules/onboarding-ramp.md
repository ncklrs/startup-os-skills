## Onboarding and Ramp Programs

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Every day of extended ramp time costs real revenue. A 30-day improvement in ramp time for a $1M quota AE is worth $83K in accelerated productivity.

### Ramp Time Benchmarks

| Role | Industry Average | Best-in-Class | Target |
|------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| **SDR** | 3 months | 6 weeks | 8 weeks |
| **SMB AE** | 4 months | 2.5 months | 3 months |
| **Mid-Market AE** | 6 months | 4 months | 5 months |
| **Enterprise AE** | 9 months | 6 months | 7 months |
| **Sales Engineer** | 6 months | 4 months | 5 months |
| **CSM** | 4 months | 2.5 months | 3 months |

### The Ramp Equation

```
Time to Productivity =
    Hire Quality
    + Onboarding Program Quality
    + Manager Coaching
    + Tool/Process Complexity
    + Market Learning Curve
```
