## Performance Measurement

**Impact: CRITICAL**

What gets measured gets managed. Enablement without measurement is just activity. With measurement, it's a strategic function that proves ROI.

### The Enablement Measurement Hierarchy

```
                    BUSINESS IMPACT
                  (Revenue, Win Rate)
                         │
                         ▼
              BEHAVIOR CHANGE
           (Activities, Adoption)
                         │
                         ▼
              SKILL APPLICATION

                         ▼
                ENGAGEMENT
           (Completion, Satisfaction)

### The Kirkpatrick + Phillips Model

| Level | What It Measures | How to Measure | Example |
|-------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| **1: Reaction** | Did they like it? | Surveys, NPS | Training satisfaction: 4.2/5 |
| **2: Learning** | Did they learn it? | Assessments, tests | Knowledge score: 85% |
| **3: Behavior** | Do they apply it? | Observation, data | Discovery adherence: 78% |
| **4: Results** | Did it impact business? | Business metrics | Win rate improved 12% |
| **5: ROI** | Was it worth it? | Revenue vs. cost | 450% ROI |

## ROI Calculation

### Investment
| Category | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| Enablement team (3 FTEs) | $450,000 |
| Enablement platform | $120,000 |
| Content development | $50,000 |
| Training events | $80,000 |
| **Total Investment** | **$700,000** |

### Returns
| Impact Area | Calculation | Value |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Ramp time reduction | 15 days × 10 new hires × $400/day | $60,000 |
| Win rate improvement | 2% × $10M pipeline | $200,000 |
| Deal size increase | 5% × $15M won revenue | $750,000 |
| Rep productivity | 2 hrs/week × 50 reps × 50 weeks × $75/hr | $375,000 |
| Reduced attrition | 5% × 50 reps × $150K cost-to-replace | $375,000 |
| **Total Returns** | | **$1,760,000** |

### ROI = (Returns - Investment) / Investment
### ROI = ($1,760,000 - $700,000) / $700,000 = **151%**
```

### Bad Measurement Example

```markdown
## Enablement "Metrics" (What NOT to Do)

We track:
- Number of training sessions delivered
- Training attendance
- Content items created
- Slide decks produced

---

PROBLEMS:
✗ Activity metrics, not outcomes
✗ No connection to business results
✗ Can't prove ROI
✗ Incentivizes volume over quality
✗ "We did 50 trainings!" — so what?
```

### Program-Specific Metrics

| Program | Leading Metrics | Lagging Metrics |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Onboarding** | Completion rate, satisfaction | Ramp time, new hire quota attainment |
| **Product Training** | Certification rate, knowledge scores | Win rate on new product, deal size |
| **Methodology** | Adherence scores, coaching time | Win rate, sales cycle, forecast accuracy |
| **Competitive** | Battle card usage | Competitive win rate |
| **Content** | Asset adoption, engagement | Deals influenced, deal velocity |
| **Coaching** | Manager coaching hours | Rep performance, retention |

### Attribution Models

| Model | How It Works | Use When |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Direct** | Trained reps vs. non-trained | Clear A/B groups |
| **Correlation** | Metric X correlates with Y | Identifying relationships |
| **Before/After** | Performance pre/post program | Single cohort |
| **Control Group** | Test vs. control group | Rigorous measurement |
| **Survey** | Self-reported attribution | Soft metrics |

### Attribution Example

```markdown
## New Discovery Training: Impact Analysis

### Method: Before/After + Correlation

BEFORE TRAINING (Q1)
- Average discovery score: 65%
- Win rate: 21%
- Sales cycle: 58 days

AFTER TRAINING (Q2-Q3)
- Average discovery score: 78% (+13 points)
- Win rate: 26% (+5 points)
- Sales cycle: 49 days (-9 days)

CORRELATION ANALYSIS
| Discovery Score | Win Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| < 60% | 15% | 45 deals |
| 60-75% | 22% | 120 deals |
| 75-90% | 32% | 85 deals |
| > 90% | 41% | 30 deals |

ATTRIBUTION
Win rate improvement from 60% → 78% discovery score:
Estimated impact: +7% win rate
Revenue impact: 7% × $10M pipeline = $700K

CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM-HIGH
(Controlled for rep tenure, territory, deal size)
```

### Benchmarks by Industry

| Metric | Industry Average | Best-in-Class | Source |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| **Time to Ramp (AE)** | 6 months | 4 months | Sales Management Association |
| **Win Rate** | 21% | 30%+ | CSO Insights |
| **Quota Attainment** | 53% | 70%+ | Xactly |
| **Rep Turnover** | 35% | <20% | Bridge Group |
| **Coaching Time** | 1.5 hrs/week | 3+ hrs/week | Vantage Point |
| **Content Usage** | 40% | 70%+ | Seismic |

### Creating a Measurement Cadence

| Frequency | Metrics | Audience | Action |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Weekly** | Completion, adoption | Enablement team | Operational adjustments |
| **Monthly** | Behavior, leading | Sales leadership | Program reviews |
| **Quarterly** | Results, outcomes | Exec team | Strategy decisions |
| **Annually** | ROI, trends | C-suite, board | Investment justification |

### Survey Best Practices

**Training Effectiveness Survey (Post-Training):**
1. Rate the relevance of this training (1-5)
2. Rate the quality of instruction (1-5)
3. How confident are you applying this? (1-5)
4. What's one thing you'll do differently?
5. What was missing?

**30-Day Follow-Up Survey:**
1. Have you applied the training? (Yes/No)
2. If yes, describe the situation
3. What was the result?
4. What support do you need?

### Anti-Patterns

- **Vanity metrics** — Tracking what's easy, not what matters
- **Activity obsession** — "We did 100 trainings" without outcomes
- **No baseline** — Can't show improvement without starting point
- **Too many metrics** — Tracking 50 things, acting on none
- **Delayed measurement** — Checking results 12 months later
- **No attribution** — "Win rate went up, enablement takes credit"
- **Ignoring quality** — Completion rates without satisfaction
- **Dashboard graveyard** — Building reports no one looks at
