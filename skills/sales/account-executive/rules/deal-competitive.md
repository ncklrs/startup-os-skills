## Competitive Displacement and Positioning

**Impact: HIGH**

Every deal has competition — even if it's "do nothing" or "build it ourselves." Elite AEs know their competitors better than the competitors know themselves, and they win by positioning, not by trashing.

### The Competitive Landscape

| Competitor Type | How to Beat Them |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Direct competitor** | Differentiation on criteria that matter |
| **Incumbent vendor** | Cost of status quo, vision of future state |
| **Build vs. buy** | TCO analysis, time to value, opportunity cost |
| **Do nothing** | Pain quantification, risk of inaction |

### The Pre-Mortem Question

Before engaging, ask yourself:

```
"If we lose this deal, what will be the reason?"

Common answers:
- "They chose [Competitor] because..."
- "They decided to stay with incumbent because..."
- "They deprioritized because..."
- "They built it themselves because..."

Address these proactively, not reactively.
```

### Competitive Intelligence Gathering

**Sources (ranked by reliability):**

| Source | Reliability | Information Type |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Your champion** | High | What competitors are saying to them |
| **Lost deal interviews** | High | Why you actually lose |
| **Customer reviews (G2, etc.)** | Medium | Strengths and weaknesses |
| **Competitor marketing** | Medium | Their positioning and claims |
| **Industry analysts** | Medium | Market perception |
| **Competitor's job postings** | Low-Medium | Their investment areas |

**Questions to ask champions:**

```
"Are you evaluating other solutions alongside us? No wrong answer —
I'd rather know so I can help you make the best decision."

"What are they saying their key differentiators are?"

"How are they positioning against us?"

"What concerns do you have about choosing us over them?"
```

### Competitive Positioning Principles

**The Golden Rules:**

1. **Never trash talk** — It backfires and looks desperate
2. **Acknowledge strengths** — Then pivot to what matters
3. **Reframe the criteria** — Shift what they evaluate
4. **Tell customer stories** — Let others validate you
5. **Win on YOUR strengths** — Don't fight on their turf

### The Positioning Framework

**Instead of:** "They're bad at X"
**Say:** "We approach X differently because..."

| When Competitor Is Strong In | Your Response |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| Feature you don't have | "That's useful for [use case], but our customers prioritize [your strength] because [reason]. Is that true for you too?" |
| Lower price | "They may cost less upfront. But when you factor in [total cost factors], our customers typically see [better outcome]." |
| Bigger/more established | "Size can be an advantage or a risk. Being [your size] means [your advantage: speed, focus, attention]." |
| More integrations | "We focus on depth over breadth. For your specific use case with [their tools], we [specific advantage]." |

### Battlecard Structure

For each major competitor, prepare:

**1. Competitor Overview**
- Company size, funding, growth
- Target market and positioning
- Recent news and changes

**2. Head-to-Head Comparison**

| Dimension | Us | Them | Guidance |
|-----------|----|----- |----------|
| [Key area 1] | Strength | Weakness | How to position |
| [Key area 2] | Weakness | Strength | How to handle |
| [Key area 3] | Parity | Parity | Differentiator |

**3. When We Win**
- Deal profile (company size, use case, priorities)
- Winning messages
- Proof points

**4. When We Lose**
- Deal profile
- Their winning messages
- How to counter

**5. Trap Questions**
- Questions they'll ask to expose our weaknesses
- Responses

**6. Landmines to Set**
- Questions that expose their weaknesses
- How to plant them naturally

### Handling "We're Also Talking to [Competitor]"

**Acknowledge and pivot:**

```
"Makes sense — [Competitor] is a solid company. What's drawing
you to evaluate them?"

[Listen to their answer]

"Got it. Where [Competitor] typically fits well is [their sweet spot].
Where we tend to win is [your differentiator]. Based on what
you've shared about your priorities around [their stated need],
I think that's where we'll show strongest. Let me show you
specifically how we address that..."
```

### Displacing an Incumbent

The hardest competitive situation. Status quo is powerful.

**The Displacement Framework:**

```
1. QUANTIFY THE PAIN OF STATUS QUO
"What is the current solution costing you in time, errors, and
missed opportunities?"

2. IDENTIFY THE TRIGGER
"What changed that made you willing to look at alternatives now?"

3. BUILD THE VISION
"What would the ideal state look like? What could your team
accomplish with the right solution?"

4. ACKNOWLEDGE SWITCHING COST
"Any change involves effort. Let me show you specifically how
we make the transition seamless — and what customers like
[reference] experienced."

5. PROVE INCREMENTAL VALUE
"In the first 30 days, you'll see [specific value]. That alone
typically justifies the investment."
```

### Landmine Questions

**Plant questions that expose competitor weaknesses:**

"When you're evaluating [area], make sure to ask about [specific
thing they can't do well]. That's often a blind spot that shows
up later in implementation."

"I'd recommend asking [Competitor] about their approach to
[their weak area]. We've heard that can be a challenge."

"One question worth asking is [question that favors you].
That'll help you compare apples to apples."

### Trap Question Responses

**"Why should we choose you over [Competitor]?"**

```
"That's a fair question. Let me share what makes the difference
for customers in your situation:

1. [Key differentiator 1] — which matters because [relevance to them]
2. [Key differentiator 2] — [peer customer] found this critical
3. [Key differentiator 3] — given your priority around [X]

What matters most to you in making this decision?"
```

**"[Competitor] is half your price."**

```
"Price is definitely a factor. Let me help you think about
total value:

[Competitor] at $X handles [their scope]. When you add [what's
missing], you're looking at $X + [additional costs].

Our $Y includes [everything], plus [unique value]. Customers
like [reference] found they actually spent less over 3 years.

Would it help to build a TCO comparison together?"
```

### Competitive Deal Strategy

| Scenario | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| **Ahead in evaluation** | Shorten timeline, lock in criteria, stay close to EB |
| **Behind in evaluation** | Change the criteria, introduce new stakeholders, find champion |
| **Unknown status** | Assume competition, ask directly, differentiate |
| **Competitor named vendor of choice** | Qualify hard — is it real or fake RFP? |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Trash talking** — Makes you look desperate
- **Ignoring competition** — They won't ignore you
- **Fighting on their turf** — Win on your strengths
- **Assuming you know their pitch** — It changes
- **No battlecard preparation** — Winging it loses deals
- **Fake RFP participation** — Wasting time on decided deals
- **Price matching reflexively** — Race to bottom
