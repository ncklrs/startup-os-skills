## Tailoring Demos to Audience and Use Case

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Generic demos lose deals. Every demo should feel like it was built specifically for the prospect sitting in front of you.

### The Personalization Hierarchy

| Level | Effort | Impact | Example |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Generic** | None | Low | Same demo for everyone |
| **Vertical** | Low | Medium | "This is our healthcare demo" |
| **Company** | Medium | High | Their logo, industry context |
| **Use Case** | High | Very High | Their specific workflow |
| **Individual** | Very High | Highest | Their data, their screens |

### Pre-Demo Discovery Checklist

**Must know before any demo:**

```
COMPANY CONTEXT
□ Industry and vertical
□ Company size (employees, revenue)
□ Growth stage (startup, scaling, enterprise)
□ Tech stack (if relevant)
□ Competitors they've evaluated

PROBLEM CONTEXT
□ Specific pain points (from discovery call)
□ Current solution/process
□ Why they're looking now (trigger event)
□ Cost of current problem (quantified if possible)
□ Timeline and urgency

STAKEHOLDER CONTEXT
□ Who will be on the call
□ Their roles and responsibilities
□ What each person cares about
□ Who's the champion, who's skeptical
□ Decision-making process

SUCCESS CRITERIA
□ What would make this demo successful?
□ What are the must-have capabilities?
□ What are the dealbreakers?
□ What's the next step if demo goes well?
```

### Vertical-Specific Demo Strategies

| Vertical | Key Concerns | Demo Emphasis | Language to Use |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Healthcare** | Compliance, PHI, security | HIPAA features, audit logs | "Patient data," "care team" |
| **Finance** | Compliance, audit, precision | SOC 2, accuracy, reconciliation | "Regulatory," "audit trail" |
| **E-commerce** | Speed, scale, revenue | Performance, conversion impact | "AOV," "cart abandonment" |
| **SaaS** | Integration, scale, NRR | API, usage analytics | "MRR," "churn," "expansion" |
| **Manufacturing** | Reliability, downtime, supply chain | Uptime, IoT integration | "OEE," "downtime," "yield" |
| **Education** | Budget, ease of use, student outcomes | Simple UI, reporting | "Student success," "retention" |

### Use Case Mapping

**Step 1: Identify their top 3 use cases**
```
From discovery: "We need to solve..."
1. [Primary use case] — This is why they took the meeting
2. [Secondary use case] — Nice to have
3. [Future use case] — Expansion opportunity
```

**Step 2: Map to your demo flow**
```
Primary use case:    60% of demo time
Secondary use case:  25% of demo time
Future use case:     10% (tease for expansion)
Buffer/questions:    5%
```

**Step 3: Create custom demo script**

For each use case:
```
CONTEXT:     "[At Company], when your team needs to [task]..."
CURRENT:     "Right now, that means [their painful process]..."
SHOW:        "[Demonstrate the workflow]"
OUTCOME:     "Now your team can [benefit], which means [value]"
PROOF:       "[Similar customer] saw [specific metric] improvement"
```

### Personalization Techniques

**1. Use Their Language**

| What You Call It | What They Might Call It | Adapt To |
|------------------|------------------------|----------|
| Leads | Prospects, opportunities, deals | Their term |
| Users | Members, customers, patients, students | Their term |
| Dashboard | Control panel, command center, cockpit | Their term |
| Pipeline | Funnel, forecast, revenue | Their term |

**2. Reference Their Context**

**Good:**
```
"I was looking at [Company]'s recent product launch —
congratulations on the Series B, by the way — and I
thought about how this feature would help you scale
your sales team without adding headcount."
```

**Bad:**
```
"So this is our pipeline management feature. Companies
use this to track their sales."
```

**3. Use Realistic Scenarios**

| Generic Scenario | Personalized Scenario |
|------------------|----------------------|
| "Let's say you have a lead named John..." | "Let's say someone from [Target Company] fills out your demo request form..." |
| "Here's a sample report..." | "Here's what your Monday morning CFO update would look like..." |
| "This is how automation works..." | "Remember that manual process you mentioned with [specific task]? Watch this..." |

### The Personalization Minimum

**Even with limited prep time, always do:**

1. **Company name/logo** — In the demo environment if possible
2. **Industry context** — One reference to their vertical
3. **Discovery callback** — "You mentioned [specific thing]..."
4. **Role relevance** — Speak to who's actually in the room
5. **Relevant metric** — One number that matters to them

### Demo Environment Personalization

| Element | Generic | Personalized |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Logo** | Your demo company | Their logo |
| **Data** | Fake names/numbers | Realistic for their context |
| **Users** | User 1, User 2 | Actual team names (if known) |
| **Scenarios** | Generic workflows | Their specific processes |
| **Metrics** | Industry averages | Their targets/goals |

### Adapting in Real-Time

**When you discover new information during demo:**

```
"That's interesting — you mentioned [new info]. Let me
actually adjust what I was going to show you. This is
more relevant..."
```

**Signals to adapt:**

| Signal | Meaning | Adaptation |
|--------|---------|------------|
| "We actually do it differently" | Your assumption was wrong | "Tell me more, let me show you how that would work" |
| "That's not really our priority" | Wrong use case | "What would be more valuable to see?" |
| "We already have that" | Table stakes, not differentiator | "Great, let me show you what we do differently" |
| Lots of questions on one area | High interest | Spend more time, offer deep-dive |
| Silence on a topic | Low interest or confusion | Ask directly, pivot if needed |

### Industry-Specific Compliance Considerations

| Industry | Compliance Framework | Demo Must Show |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Healthcare | HIPAA, HITRUST | Data encryption, access controls, audit logs |
| Finance | SOC 2, SOX, PCI-DSS | Audit trail, role separation, data protection |
| Government | FedRAMP, ITAR | Data residency, security certifications |
| EU Companies | GDPR | Data handling, consent management, DPA |
| Education | FERPA | Student data protection, parental controls |

### Anti-Patterns

- **No discovery reference** — Never mentioning their specific situation
- **Wrong vertical context** — Healthcare examples for finance prospect
- **Outdated research** — Referencing their old product/situation
- **Over-personalization** — Seeming like you stalked them
- **Generic demo data** — "Acme Corp" when you could use their context
- **Assumption without confirmation** — "I assume you do X..." without checking
- **One-size-fits-all script** — Reading same thing to every audience
