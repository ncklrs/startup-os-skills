## Stakeholder Mapping and Multi-Stakeholder Demos

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Enterprise deals have 6-10 stakeholders. Your demo must speak to all of them — often simultaneously. Map the room before you enter it.

### Stakeholder Archetypes

| Archetype | Role | Cares About | Demo Focus | Objection Pattern |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Economic Buyer** | Signs the check | ROI, risk, strategic fit | Business outcomes, metrics | "What's the business case?" |
| **Champion** | Wants you to win | Making themselves look good | Give them ammo for internal sell | "How do I convince my boss?" |
| **Technical Evaluator** | Validates feasibility | Integration, security, scale | Architecture, APIs, compliance | "How does this actually work?" |
| **End User** | Uses it daily | Ease of use, workflow fit | UX, common tasks, learning curve | "Will this make my job harder?" |
| **Blocker** | Has concerns/agenda | Status quo, competing priorities | Risk mitigation, migration ease | "Why change what's working?" |
| **Coach** | Guides you internally | Helping you navigate | Political landscape, timing | N/A (ask them questions) |

### Pre-Demo Stakeholder Research

**For each attendee, know:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ NAME:          [Full name and pronunciation]           │
│ TITLE:         [Role and department]                   │
│ ARCHETYPE:     [Economic/Champion/Technical/User/etc.] │
│ CARE ABOUT:    [Top 2-3 priorities]                    │
│ SUCCESS LOOKS: [What would make this demo a win?]      │
│ POTENTIAL OBJECTION: [What might they push back on?]   │
│ RELATIONSHIP:  [Who do they influence/report to?]      │
│ LINKEDIN:      [Recent posts, shared connections]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Multi-Stakeholder Demo Structure

**The Challenge:** Different stakeholders need different things at different depths.

**The Solution:** Layered demo with explicit handoffs.

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  EXECUTIVE LAYER (First 10 min)                       │
│  - Business outcomes, metrics, strategic value        │
│  - "Here's the 30,000-foot view of impact"           │
│  - Executives can drop after this if needed           │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  OPERATIONAL LAYER (Middle 15 min)                    │
│  - Workflows, collaboration, day-to-day use          │
│  - Managers and power users most engaged here         │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TECHNICAL LAYER (Final 10 min or separate call)      │
│  - Integration, security, implementation              │
│  - IT/Dev team deep-dive                              │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Room Reading Techniques

**Watch for:**

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Nodding | Engaged, agreeing | Continue, maybe speed up |
| Note-taking | High interest | Offer to send details |
| Phone checking | Lost interest | Ask a question, pivot |
| Side conversations | Confusion or politics | Pause, address directly |
| Arms crossed | Skeptical | Ask for their perspective |
| Leaning forward | Very engaged | This is a key moment, slow down |
| Questions | Engaged (usually) | Answer, then redirect |

### Managing the Multi-Stakeholder Dynamic

**Technique 1: Explicit Layering**
```
"I'm going to structure this in three parts. First,
I'll show the strategic value — Sarah and Mike, this
is where I'd love your input. Then we'll go into the
operational workflow — Tom, I know you flagged some
specific scenarios. Finally, we'll touch on technical
integration — Jane, save your questions for that section
or jump in anytime."
```

**Technique 2: Named Callbacks**
```
"This is what I was describing earlier, Mike, when
you asked about scaling across regions..."

"Sarah, remember you mentioned the CFO wants weekly
reports? This is that exact scenario..."
```

**Technique 3: Stakeholder Spotlights**
```
After showing a workflow, ask specific stakeholders:

"Tom, does this match how your team would actually use this?"
"Jane, any technical concerns with what you've seen so far?"
"Mike, does this address the compliance requirement you mentioned?"
```

### Handling Stakeholder Conflict

**When stakeholders have competing priorities:**

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Technical person derails with deep questions | "Great question, Jane. Let's capture that for the technical deep-dive so we can give it proper attention." |
| Executive seems bored by details | "Sarah, I know your time is limited. The key takeaway is [benefit]. Want to stay for the rest or shall I follow up with a summary?" |
| Blocker raises objections | "That's a fair concern, David. Can you tell me more about what you've seen before that makes you cautious?" |
| Champion trying too hard | "Thanks Mike. [To room] I appreciate Mike's enthusiasm — what questions do the rest of you have?" |

### The RACI for Demo Success

| Role | Responsibility | How to Serve Them |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Responsible** | End users who'll use it | Show it makes their job easier |
| **Accountable** | Economic buyer | Prove ROI and low risk |
| **Consulted** | Technical team | Prove it works and integrates |
| **Informed** | Broader stakeholders | Keep demo focused, share recording |

### Stakeholder-Specific "Aha" Moments

**Plan one "aha moment" for each key stakeholder:**

| Stakeholder | Their "Aha" Moment |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **CFO** | Dashboard showing cost savings vs current spend |
| **IT Director** | SSO integration that works in 3 clicks |
| **Sales Manager** | Report that used to take 4 hours generated instantly |
| **Sales Rep** | Deal data auto-populated from email |
| **Security** | Audit log with compliance-ready exports |

### Power Dynamics Mapping

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │ ECONOMIC    │
                    │ BUYER       │
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
              ┌────────────┼────────────┐
              │            │            │
        ┌─────▼─────┐ ┌────▼────┐ ┌─────▼─────┐
        │ CHAMPION  │ │ BLOCKER │ │ TECHNICAL │
        │           │ │         │ │ EVALUATOR │
        └─────┬─────┘ └────┬────┘ └─────┬─────┘
              │            │            │
              └────────────┼────────────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼──────┐
                    │  END USERS  │
                    └─────────────┘

Influence flows upward. Win the bottom, use champions
to influence the top. Neutralize blockers.
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Presenting to the most senior person only** — Ignoring the room
- **Treating all stakeholders equally** — Not prioritizing
- **Not knowing the room** — Going in blind
- **Ignoring the quiet ones** — They may be the real decision maker
- **Letting one person dominate** — Not managing the dynamic
- **Same pitch to everyone** — One-size-fits-all messaging
- **Missing the coach** — Not identifying your internal ally
