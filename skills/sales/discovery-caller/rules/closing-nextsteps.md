## Next Steps and Commitment

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Every discovery call must end with a clear next step and commitment. "I'll send you some info" is not a next step - it's a dead deal walking.

### The Next Step Hierarchy

```
STRONGEST COMMITMENT:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Calendar invite sent and accepted for specific next meeting │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Verbal agreement to specific date/time for next meeting     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Agreement to specific next action with timeline             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Vague agreement to "follow up next week"                    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ↓
WEAKEST COMMITMENT:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ "Send me some info" / No specific next step                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Strong vs. Weak Next Steps

| Weak Next Step | Strong Next Step |
|----------------|------------------|
| "I'll send you some info" | "Let's schedule a demo for Tuesday at 2pm" |
| "We'll be in touch" | "Can we get 30 min on your calendar for Thursday?" |
| "Let me think about it" | "What would you need to see to make a decision?" |
| "I'll share with my team" | "Can we schedule a call that includes your team?" |
| "Circle back next quarter" | "Let's schedule a check-in for March 1st" |

### The Commitment Close

**Reserve 5 minutes at the end of every call for closing.**

**Framework: Summarize → Confirm → Propose → Lock**

```
SUMMARIZE:
"Let me make sure I captured everything. You're dealing with [pain 1]
and [pain 2], which is costing roughly [quantified impact]. Your
priority is [goal] and you're looking to have something in place
by [timeline]. Does that capture it?"

CONFIRM:
"Does it make sense to keep this conversation going?"
[If yes, continue. If hesitation, address it.]

PROPOSE:
"Based on what you shared, I think a good next step would be
[specific next step] with [specific people]. How does that sound?"

LOCK:
"Great. I have availability on [Day 1] at [Time] or [Day 2] at [Time].
Which works better for you?"
[Send invite while still on call if possible]
```

### Next Step Options by Stage

| Discovery Stage | Appropriate Next Step |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **First call, qualified** | Demo/presentation with decision criteria |
| **Multiple stakeholders needed** | Broader meeting with buying committee |
| **Technical concerns** | Deep-dive with technical evaluator |
| **Need business case** | ROI review with economic buyer |
| **Competitive evaluation** | Proof of concept or trial |
| **Near decision** | Proposal review and negotiation |

### Getting Calendar Commitment

**The Live Calendar Technique:**
```
"I have my calendar up right now. I see I have Tuesday at 2pm or
Thursday at 10am available. Which works better for your schedule?"
[Wait for response]
"Great, I'm sending the invite right now. Can you confirm you received it?"
```

**The Assumptive Close:**
```
"It sounds like a demo would be valuable. Let me pull up my calendar -
what does your availability look like next Tuesday or Wednesday?"
```

**The Alternative Close:**
```
"Would it work better to do the technical deep-dive first, or would
you rather bring in your VP for a higher-level conversation?"
```

### Handling Next Step Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I need to think about it" | "Of course. What specific things would you want to think through? I might be able to help address them now." |
| "Send me some info" | "Happy to. What specific information would be most valuable? And should we schedule a quick call to discuss after you've reviewed?" |
| "I'll discuss with my team" | "Great. Would it make sense to schedule a call that includes them? That way I can answer questions directly." |
| "Call me next week" | "Absolutely. What day and time works? Let's get it on the calendar now so it doesn't slip." |
| "We're not ready yet" | "Understood. What would need to happen for you to be ready? And when do you expect that to be?" |

### The Mutual Action Plan

For complex deals, establish a mutual action plan:

```
MUTUAL ACTION PLAN: [Company Name]

Goal: [Customer] implementing [Product] by [Date]

DATE        | ACTION                  | OWNER       | STATUS
------------|-------------------------|-------------|--------
Jan 15      | Discovery call          | Both        | Complete
Jan 22      | Technical deep-dive     | [Tech Lead] | Scheduled
Jan 29      | Demo with VP Eng        | [Rep]       | Pending
Feb 5       | Trial kickoff           | Both        | Pending
Feb 19      | Trial review            | Both        | Pending
Feb 26      | Proposal review         | [Rep]       | Pending
March 1     | Contract review         | [Legal]     | Pending
March 15    | Go-live                 | [Customer]  | Pending

Dependencies:
- Trial requires security review (scheduled Jan 25)
- VP approval needed before proposal

Risks:
- Budget approval timeline unclear
```

### Testing Commitment

**Commitment tests during the call:**
```
"If what you see in the demo addresses your concerns, what would
be the next step from there?"

"Assuming this looks like a fit, what would the decision
process look like?"

"What would need to happen for you to move forward this quarter?"

"Is there anything that could prevent this from happening?"
```

**Reading commitment signals:**

| Strong Commitment | Weak Commitment |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Volunteers additional stakeholders | Avoids discussing others |
| Asks about implementation | Focused only on features |
| Shares timeline and drivers | Vague on timing |
| Discusses budget openly | Deflects budget questions |
| Accepts meeting invites immediately | "I'll check my calendar and get back" |

### Ending the Call Strong

**Good call endings:**
```
"This was really valuable. Here's what we agreed to:
1. I'll send the case study by end of day
2. You'll share with your security team
3. We're meeting Tuesday at 2pm with the broader group
4. I'm sending the invite now - please accept when you get it.
Sound right?"
```

**Bad call endings:**
```
"Okay, well, let me know if you have questions."

"I'll send you some stuff."

"Good chatting, talk soon."

"Let me know when you're ready to move forward."
```

### Follow-Up Cadence

| Action | Timing |
|--------|--------|
| Send calendar invite | During or immediately after call |
| Send recap email | Within 2 hours |
| Send promised materials | Same day |
| Confirmation check | 24 hours before next meeting |
| Follow-up if no response | 48-72 hours after email |

**Recap Email Template:**
```
Subject: Recap: [Company] + [Your Company] Discovery Call

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the great conversation today. Here's what I captured:

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- [Pain point 1 with quantified impact]
- [Pain point 2 with quantified impact]
- [Timeline/urgency driver]

AGREED NEXT STEPS:
- [Action 1] - Owner: [Name] - By: [Date]
- [Action 2] - Owner: [Name] - By: [Date]
- [Meeting scheduled] - [Date/Time] - Attendees: [Names]

ATTACHED:

- [Relevant document 2]

Please let me know if I missed anything. Looking forward to

### Anti-Patterns

- **No close attempt** — Ending call without asking for next step
- **Accepting vague answers** — "Let's talk next week" without specifics
- **Not sending invite live** — Losing momentum after call
- **Single-action next step** — "I'll send info" without follow-up meeting
- **No recap email** — Verbal agreements get forgotten
- **Chasing instead of leading** — "Let me know when you're free" vs proposing times
