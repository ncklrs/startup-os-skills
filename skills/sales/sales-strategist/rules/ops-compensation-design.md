## Sales Compensation Plan Design

**Impact: HIGH**

Compensation drives behavior. Every decision in your comp plan sends a message about what you value. Get it right and you align rep motivation with company goals. Get it wrong and you create perverse incentives, sandbagging, and churn.

### Compensation Design Principles

1. **Simple enough to explain** — If reps can't calculate earnings, they can't optimize
2. **Aligned with company goals** — Pay for outcomes you want
3. **Competitive to attract talent** — Match or beat market
4. **Balanced for retention** — Both short-term and long-term incentives
5. **Fair across territories** — Equal opportunity, not equal outcome

### Base vs. Variable Split

| Role | Base:Variable | Rationale |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| SDR | 70:30 | High activity, lower deal control |
| SMB AE | 50:50 | Balanced, rep controls outcome |
| Mid-Market AE | 50:50 | Standard for quota-carrying |
| Enterprise AE | 55:45 or 60:40 | Longer cycles, more patience |
| Strategic AE | 60:40 | Multi-year deals, relationship focus |
| Sales Manager | 60:40 or 70:30 | Team management, less direct selling |

### OTE Benchmarking

**2024-2025 Market Rates (US, SaaS):**

| Role | OTE Range | Base Range | Variable Range |
|------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| SDR | $65K-$90K | $45K-$65K | $20K-$30K |
| BDR (Outbound) | $70K-$100K | $50K-$70K | $25K-$35K |
| SMB AE | $100K-$150K | $50K-$75K | $50K-$75K |
| MM AE | $150K-$250K | $75K-$125K | $75K-$125K |
| Enterprise AE | $250K-$400K | $140K-$220K | $110K-$180K |
| Strategic AE | $350K-$500K+ | $200K-$280K | $150K-$220K |
| Sales Manager | $180K-$300K | $120K-$180K | $60K-$120K |
| Director | $250K-$400K | $160K-$240K | $90K-$160K |
| VP Sales | $350K-$600K+ | $220K-$350K | $130K-$250K |

### Commission Structures

**Structure 1: Flat Rate**
```
Commission = Revenue × Rate

Example:
- AE closes $100K deal
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission: $10,000

Pros: Simple, predictable
Cons: No acceleration, no differentiation
Best for: Early-stage, simple products
```

**Structure 2: Tiered/Accelerated**
```
Commission Rate Tiers:

Attainment     | Rate  | Effective Rate
─────────────────────────────────────────
0-80%          | 8%    | 8%
81-100%        | 10%   | ~9%
101-120%       | 12%   | ~10%
121%+          | 15%   | ~11%+

Example ($1M quota, $1.2M closed):
- First $800K: $800K × 8% = $64K
- Next $200K: $200K × 10% = $20K
- Final $200K: $200K × 12% = $24K
Total: $108K commission

Pros: Rewards overperformance
Cons: Complex, potential sandbagging
Best for: Growth-stage companies
```

**Structure 3: Multiplier Model**
```
Commission = Base Rate × Attainment Multiplier

Multiplier Table:
Attainment | Multiplier
─────────────────────────
<70%       | 0.5x
70-90%     | 0.8x
90-100%    | 1.0x
100-110%   | 1.2x
110-130%   | 1.5x
130%+      | 2.0x

Example ($1M quota, 10% base rate):
- Closed: $1.15M (115% attainment)
- Base commission: $1.15M × 10% = $115K
- Multiplier: 1.5x
- Actual commission: $115K × 1.5 = $172.5K

Pros: Strong overperformance incentive
Cons: Expensive at high attainment
Best for: High-growth, competitive hiring
```

### Comp Plan Components

```

```

### SPIFs and Bonuses

**SPIF (Sales Performance Incentive Fund) Guidelines:**

| Type | When to Use | Structure |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Product Launch | New product adoption | $ per deal or % of new product |
| End of Quarter | Pipeline acceleration | Bonus for closes by date |
| Competitive Win | Taking share | $ per competitive displacement |
| Strategic Initiative | Behavior change | $ for specific actions |
| Pipeline Building | Low coverage | $ per qualified opportunity |

**SPIF Design Rules:**
- Time-limited (1-4 weeks max)
- Simple and clear
- Significant enough to change behavior
- Not recurring (becomes entitlement)

```
Example SPIF:

"Q4 Close Accelerator SPIF"

Goal: Pull forward December pipeline to November

Mechanics:
- Any deal closed by November 30th
- That was forecasted for December
- Earns an additional 2% commission

Duration: November 1-30 only
Budget: $50K cap

Communication:
- Announced November 1st
- Weekly leaderboard
- Paid with December commissions
```

### Good Comp Plan Design

```
Well-Designed Mid-Market AE Plan:

OTE: $200K (50/50 split)
Quota: $900K (4.5x OTE)

Commission Structure:
├── 0-90%: 10% flat
├── 90-100%: 11% (slight reward for hitting)
├── 100-120%: 13% (meaningful acceleration)
└── 120%+: 15% (uncapped)

Blended Components:
├── New Business: 80% weight
├── Expansion: 15% weight
└── Multi-year bonus: 5% weight

Payment Terms:
├── Monthly payment
├── Paid on booking (not collection)
└── Clawback: 90 days, 100%

Why it works:
✓ Simple enough to calculate quickly
✓ Meaningful acceleration at quota
✓ Aligned with company goals (new + expansion)
✓ Uncapped to reward top performers
✓ Clear clawback policy
✓ Competitive OTE for the role
```

### Bad Comp Plan Design

```
Problematic Enterprise Plan:

OTE: $300K (60/40 split)
Quota: $2M (6.7x OTE - too high)

Commission Structure:
├── Paid on collection, not booking
├── 12-month clawback
├── Capped at 150% of target variable
├── Quarterly reset (no banking)
├── 7 different commission rates by product
├── Requires 90% of 5 different KPIs to unlock variable

Problems:
✗ Quota too high for OTE
✗ Paid on collection (not rep's control)
✗ 12-month clawback is punitive
✗ Cap discourages overperformance
✗ Quarterly reset creates gaming
✗ Too complex to understand
✗ Multi-KPI gates are demotivating
```

### Clawback Policy

**Standard Clawback Guidelines:**

| Scenario | Policy |
|----------|--------|
| Customer cancels within 30 days | 100% clawback |
| Customer cancels 31-90 days | 75-100% clawback |
| Customer cancels 91-180 days | 50% clawback (case-by-case) |
| Customer cancels 180+ days | No clawback |
| Rep leaves before close | No commission (deal transfers) |
| Bad faith sale (false promises) | 100% clawback + disciplinary |

**What NOT to Clawback:**
- Customer churn due to product issues
- Customer churn due to CS failure
- Customer goes out of business
- M&A causes cancellation

### Manager Compensation

**Manager Comp Structures:**

| Model | How It Works | When to Use |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Team Quota | % of team revenue | Simple, aligned |
| Override | % of each rep's commission | Direct report incentive |
| Blended | Base + team + individual | Player/coach role |
| MBO | Base + objectives | Non-quota roles |

```
Example Sales Manager Plan:

Base: $150K
Target Variable: $100K
OTE: $250K

Variable Breakdown:
├── Team Quota Attainment: 70%
│   └── Team quota: $6M
│   └── Commission: 1.5% of team revenue
├── Rep Development: 15%
│   └── 2+ reps at 100%+ = full payout
├── Forecast Accuracy: 10%
│   └── Within 10% = full payout
└── Strategic Objectives: 5%
    └── Defined quarterly
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Complexity overload** — Plans no one can calculate
- **Too many metrics** — Dilutes focus
- **Caps on earnings** — Demotivates top performers
- **Punitive clawbacks** — Creates fear, not motivation
- **Retroactive changes** — Destroys trust
- **Paying on collection** — Rep can't control payment timing
- **Quarterly resets** — Creates end-of-quarter chaos
- **Uncompetitive OTE** — Lose talent to competitors
