## Stakeholder Alignment & Internal Selling

**Impact: HIGH**

Your proposal must arm your champion to sell internally. Every stakeholder has different priorities; address them all.

### The Buying Committee Reality

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 B2B BUYING COMMITTEE                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│   Average B2B purchase: 6-10 stakeholders involved          │
│   Each has different priorities, concerns, success metrics  │
│   If one stakeholder objects, deal stalls                   │
│                                                             │
│   Your champion can't sell alone — give them ammunition     │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### Bad Example: Single-Perspective Proposal

```markdown
## Why Choose SecretStash

SecretStash is a comprehensive secrets management platform
that provides enterprise-grade security, developer-friendly
tooling, and seamless integrations.

Our platform features:
- AES-256 encryption
- Role-based access control
- Automated secret rotation
- Audit logging
- SSO integration
- CI/CD plugins
- REST API

Join over 500 companies who trust SecretStash for their
secrets management needs.
```

**Why it fails:**
- One-size-fits-all message
- Feature-focused, not outcome-focused
- Doesn't address any specific stakeholder
- Can't be used to sell internally
- No "what's in it for me" for any role

### Creating "Leave-Behind" Content

**For each key stakeholder, create:**

| Stakeholder | Leave-Behind | Format |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| CEO | Strategic value summary | 1-page PDF |
| CFO | ROI calculator | Excel + PDF summary |
| CTO | Technical architecture | Architecture diagram + FAQ |
| Security | Compliance checklist | PDF checklist |
| Champion | Internal pitch deck | PowerPoint |

### The Champion Enablement Package

**Give your champion tools to sell internally:**

```markdown
## Champion Kit (included with proposal)

We want to make your internal conversations easier:

1. **Executive Summary (1-pager)**
   - Standalone doc for leadership review
   - Hit the high points without the detail

2. **ROI Calculator (Excel)**
   - Plug in your own numbers
   - Sensitivity analysis built in
   - CFO-ready format

3. **Technical FAQ**
   - Common questions from engineering
   - Integration details
   - Security architecture

4. **Reference Package**
   - 3 similar customers who agreed to reference calls
   - Matched to your industry and scale

5. **Internal Presentation Template**
   - Slides you can customize
   - Talking points for each audience
   - Objection handling guide
```

### Objection Handling by Stakeholder

| Stakeholder | Common Objection | Counter |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| **CEO** | "Not strategic right now" | Connect to company OKRs, show competitive risk |
| **CFO** | "Too expensive" | ROI analysis, cost of inaction, phased approach |
| **CTO** | "Not our architecture" | Flexible integration, hybrid support |
| **Security** | "Doesn't meet our requirements" | Compliance mapping, gap analysis |
| **Procurement** | "Process takes 6 months" | Expedited path, executive sponsor |
| **Champion** | "Can't get consensus" | Stakeholder-specific content, exec alignment |

### Questions to Uncover Stakeholders

Ask during discovery:

```
"Who else will be involved in evaluating this?"

"Whose approval do we need beyond yours?"

"What does the sign-off process look like?"

"Is there anyone who might object? What would their concern be?"

"Has [CFO/CTO/Security] been involved in similar decisions?"

"What happened with the last vendor you brought in?"
```

### Proposal Navigation Aids

**Make it easy for different readers:**

```markdown
## How to Use This Proposal

**If you have 2 minutes:** Read the Executive Summary (page 2)

**If you have 10 minutes:** Add the Solution Overview (pages 4-6)
and Investment Summary (page 10)

**If you're evaluating technically:** Focus on Approach and
Integration sections (pages 6-9)

**If you're approving budget:** Executive Summary (page 2) and
Investment & ROI (pages 10-12)

**If you're reviewing terms:** See Section 8 (page 14) and
attached MSA
```

### Stakeholder Sign-Off Tracking

**Include in proposal or follow-up:**

```markdown
## Approval Pathway

Based on our discussion, here's the path to approval:

| Stakeholder | Role | Status | Target Date |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| Sarah Chen | Champion | Reviewing | March 20 |
| Marcus Johnson | Security | Pending | March 22 |
| Jennifer Martinez | Budget approval | Awaiting review | March 25 |
| David Park | Technical validation | Pending | March 22 |
| Procurement | Contract review | Not started | March 28 |

**Target decision date:** April 1, 2025
**Implementation start:** April 15, 2025
```

### Consensus-Building Strategies

**When stuck:**
```
1. Identify the blocker: Who hasn't bought in? Why?
2. Get facetime: Direct conversation > email chain
3. Find common ground: What do they agree on?
4. Address specific concerns: Not generic reassurance
5. Create urgency: What's the cost of delay?
6. Escalate if needed: Champion helps navigate
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Single-threaded** — Relying only on champion
- **One message** — Same pitch for everyone
- **Ignoring procurement** — They control the process
- **Technical-only** — Forgetting business stakeholders
- **No enablement** — Champion can't sell without tools
- **Assuming alignment** — Consensus doesn't happen automatically
