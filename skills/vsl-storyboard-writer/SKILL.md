# VSL Storyboard Writer

Expert video sales letter and product marketing script writer specializing in high-converting video content that drives action. This skill bridges copywriting and video production, creating storyboard scripts ready for motion design implementation.

## Philosophy

Great video sales scripts combine three elements:

1. **Sales psychology** — Understanding what drives decisions at each stage
2. **Visual storytelling** — Every scene advances both narrative and conversion
3. **Production readiness** — Scripts that motion designers can implement immediately

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, this skill guides you through creating storyboard scripts that include:

- **Hook-focused openings** — Proven patterns to grab attention in 3-5 seconds
- **Narrative flow** — Story structures that build desire and urgency
- **Scene-by-scene scripts** — Visual descriptions, copy, timing, and rationale
- **Conversion optimization** — Strategic placement of social proof, objection handling, CTAs
- **Motion design handoff** — Format compatible with `/motion-designer` skill

The output is a complete storyboard script that feeds directly into the motion designer workflow for Remotion implementation.

## Core Frameworks

### VSL Formula Hierarchy

Choose framework based on video length and objective:

| Formula | Best For | Duration | Structure |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Hook-CTA** | Social media ads | 15-30s | Problem → Solution → CTA |
| **PAS** | Cold traffic | 30-90s | Problem → Agitation → Solution |
| **AIDA** | Product demos | 60-120s | Attention → Interest → Desire → Action |
| **VSL Classic** | Sales pages | 3-10min | Story → Problem → Solution → Proof → Offer → CTA |
| **The Explainer** | Education-first | 60-180s | Context → How it works → Benefits → CTA |

### The 5-Second Hook Formula

First 5 seconds determine 80% of watch-through rate.

**Hook Types**:
1. **Question Hook** — "What if [desired outcome] was actually easy?"
2. **Problem Hook** — "Tired of [pain point]?"
3. **Curiosity Hook** — "This [simple thing] changed everything"
4. **Pattern Interrupt** — Unexpected visual or statement
5. **Social Proof Hook** — "10,000 teams already [outcome]"
6. **Demonstration Hook** — Show impressive result immediately

### Video Length Guidelines

| Duration | Type | Goal | Key Metrics |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| 6-15s | Micro-content | Awareness, virality | Shares, engagement |
| 15-30s | Social ads | Traffic, interest | CTR, view-through |
| 30-60s | Product teasers | Demo requests | Click rate |
| 60-90s | Explainers | Understanding | Watch time |
| 90-180s | Full demos | Trial signups | Conversion rate |
| 3-10min | VSL sales videos | Purchase decisions | Sales |

### The AIDA Arc for VSL

**Attention (0-15%)**:
- Hook with problem or question
- Pattern interrupt
- Relatable scenario

**Interest (15-40%)**:
- Agitate the problem
- Show why current solutions fail
- Introduce unique mechanism

**Desire (40-80%)**:
- Demonstrate solution in action
- Social proof and testimonials
- Paint the transformation
- Handle objections

**Action (80-100%)**:
- Clear, specific offer
- Urgency or scarcity
- Risk reversal
- Multiple CTAs

### The PAS Framework

**Problem (0-25%)**:
- Identify specific, relatable pain point
- Use "you" language
- Visual: Show the struggle

**Agitate (25-50%)**:
- Why this problem is getting worse
- Cost of inaction
- Failed alternatives
- Visual: Amplify the frustration

**Solution (50-100%)**:
- Introduce your product/service
- Show it working
- Proof it works
- Easy next step
- Visual: Transformation moment

## Storyboard Script Format

When creating a storyboard, use this structure:

### 1. Script Header

```markdown
# [Video Title]

**Type**: [VSL / Explainer / Product Demo / Social Ad]
**Duration**: [Total seconds]
**Objective**: [Primary conversion goal]
**Target Audience**: [Specific persona]
**Framework**: [AIDA / PAS / Hook-CTA / etc.]

## Key Message
[Single sentence: What should viewers remember?]

## Desired Action
[Specific CTA: What should viewers do?]
```

### 2. Script Overview

```markdown
## Story Arc

**Hook (0-Xs)**: [How we grab attention]
**Build (Xs-Ys)**: [How we build interest/desire]
**Peak (Ys-Zs)**: [Climax / main value proposition]
**Close (Zs-End)**: [CTA and resolution]

## Emotional Journey
Start: [Frustrated / Curious / Overwhelmed]
→ Middle: [Hopeful / Intrigued]

```

### 3. Scene-by-Scene Storyboard

For each scene:

```markdown
## Scene N: [Scene Name] (Xs - Ys, Duration: Zs)

**Narrative Purpose**: [Why this scene exists in the story]

**On-Screen Copy**:
"[Exact text that appears on screen]"

**Viewer Psychology**:
[What the viewer should think/feel at this moment]
- Emotional state we're creating
- Objection we're handling (if applicable)
- Desire we're building

**Sales Elements**:
[Any conversion tactics used]
- Social proof placement

## VSL Storyboard Template

Here's a complete template for quick reference:

```markdown
# [Video Title]

**Type**: Product Demo VSL
**Duration**: 90 seconds

## Integration with Motion Designer

This skill produces storyboard scripts that the `/motion-designer` skill uses to create technical video specifications:

**Storyboard Script** (this skill) → **Video Spec** (motion-designer) → **Remotion Implementation** (dev)

When creating storyboards:
1. Focus on copy, messaging, and conversion strategy
2. Provide visual direction but not technical specs
3. Include timing guidance but not frame-by-frame details
4. Emphasize WHY each scene exists (narrative + conversion)
5. Let motion designer handle HOW to execute visually

## Common Video Types

### Short-Form Social (15-30s)

**Formula**: Hook → Value → CTA

```markdown
Scene 1 (0-3s): Bold question or problem
Scene 2 (3-12s): Show solution in action (demo)
Scene 3 (12-20s): Single benefit + social proof number
Scene 4 (20-30s): Simple CTA
```

### Product Explainer (60-90s)

**Formula**: Context → Demo → Benefits → CTA

```markdown
Scene 1 (0-5s): Relatable problem hook
Scene 2 (5-15s): Why existing solutions fail
Scene 3 (15-30s): Introduce your solution
Scene 4 (30-50s): Show it working (3 key features)
Scene 5 (50-70s): Transformation / benefits
Scene 6 (70-80s): Social proof
Scene 7 (80-90s): Clear CTA
```

### Full VSL (3-5min)

**Formula**: Story → Problem → Solution → Proof → Offer → Close

```markdown
Act 1 - Setup (0-45s):
  - Personal story or customer story
  - Establish credibility
  - Introduce problem

Act 2 - Problem (45s-90s):
  - Deep dive into pain points
  - Why current solutions don't work
  - Cost of status quo

Act 3 - Solution (90s-180s):
  - Introduce product/service
  - Unique mechanism
  - How it works (demo)
  - Key benefits

Act 4 - Proof (180s-240s):
  - Case studies
  - Testimonials
  - Results/data
  - Objection handling

Act 5 - Offer (240s-270s):
  - What you get
  - Pricing
  - Bonuses
  - Guarantee

Act 6 - Close (270s-300s):
  - Urgency/scarcity
  - Final CTA
  - Reminder of transformation
```

## Conversion Optimization Principles

### Social Proof Placement

- **Early social proof** (15-25% mark): Build credibility before big claims
- **Feature proof** (40-60% mark): Testimonials after each key benefit
- **Final proof** (80-90% mark): Results-focused before CTA

### Objection Handling Sequence

Common objections to address in order:

1. **Does it work?** → Demo + proof
2. **Will it work for me?** → Use cases / customer stories
3. **Is it too complicated?** → Show simplicity
4. **Is it worth the money?** → ROI / value equation
5. **What if it doesn't work?** → Guarantee / risk reversal

### CTA Best Practices

- **Frequency**: Minimum 2 CTAs (mid-point teaser + final)
- **Clarity**: Specific action ("Start free trial" not "Learn more")
- **Friction**: Remove ("No credit card" if true)
- **Urgency**: Time or quantity limits (if genuine)

## Anti-Patterns

### Script-Level
- **Feature dumping** — List features without benefits or story
- **No hook** — Slow build that loses viewers immediately
- **Unclear CTA** — Vague next step or multiple competing CTAs
- **All tell, no show** — Talking about product instead of showing it
- **Dishonest urgency** — Fake countdown timers, false scarcity

### Scene-Level
- **Wall of text** — Too much copy on screen at once
- **Orphaned scenes** — Scene doesn't advance narrative or conversion
- **No breathing room** — No time for messages to land
- **Inconsistent tone** — Voice shifts between scenes

### Production
- **Not production-ready** — Vague visuals that motion designer must guess
- **Missing timing** — No scene durations or pacing guidance
- **No assets list** — Unclear what's needed to produce

## Expert Tips

### Script Writing
- Start with the CTA, work backwards (what journey gets them there?)
- Write for the ear if using voiceover (conversational, not formal)
- One message per scene (don't try to say everything everywhere)
- Test your hook independently (does it work as a standalone ad?)

### Conversion Psychology
- Lead with transformation, not features
- Use specific numbers ("10,000 customers" not "thousands")
- Name the pain before naming the solution
- Create urgency through value, not fake scarcity

### Production Planning
- Plan for silent viewing (60%+ watch without sound)
- Consider aspect ratios early (16:9, 9:16, 1:1)
- Budget 30% longer than you think for final duration
- Leave flexibility for motion designer creativity

### Collaboration
- Provide examples of visual style you envision
- Reference other videos when helpful ("like X but for Y")
- Be clear about non-negotiables vs nice-to-haves
- Trust motion designer for technical execution
