## Motion Designer Handoff Format

**Impact: CRITICAL**

The storyboard script is the bridge between sales strategy and video production. It must be detailed enough for the motion designer to execute without guesswork, while leaving room for creative implementation.

## The Handoff Philosophy

**Your job (Storyboard Writer)**:
- WHY each scene exists (narrative purpose)
- WHAT appears on screen (copy, key visuals)
- WHAT we want viewers to think/feel (psychology)
- WHEN things happen (timing, pacing)

**Motion Designer's job**:
- HOW to execute visually (animation style, techniques)
- HOW to make it look good (design decisions)
- HOW to implement in Remotion (technical execution)

## Scene Description Best Practices

### Good Scene Description

```markdown
## Scene 3: Solution Reveal (15s - 25s, Duration: 10s)

**Narrative Purpose**:
The "a-ha" moment where viewers understand our unique approach. We're
showing that our solution is fundamentally different, not just another
tool in a crowded market.

**Viewer Psychology**:
Curiosity satisfaction ("oh, that's clever") combined with hope
("this could actually work for me"). We're building confidence that
our approach is both novel and practical.

**On-Screen Copy**:
---
One dashboard. Every platform.
Real attribution.
---

**Visual Description**:

Background:
  - Clean, light gradient (white to subtle blue)
  - Professional, uncluttered

Main Elements:
  - Center screen: Unified dashboard interface
  - Multiple marketing platform logos (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)
    feeding data into the central dashboard
  - Visual "aha": All conflicting data becomes one clear number

Supporting Elements:
  - Small animated data streams flowing from platforms to dashboard
  - Single, prominent ROI number that's clearly accurate

Text Treatment:
  - "One dashboard. Every platform." - Bold, confident
  - "Real attribution." - Emphasized, this is the key promise

**Sales Elements**:
- Unique mechanism: Showing how we're different (unified data)
- Benefit: Implicit (no more confusion)

**Motion Designer Notes**:

Pacing: Medium to slow - let viewers absorb the concept

Emphasis:
  - The moment when multiple data sources consolidate into one
  - The final ROI number appearing (make this satisfying)

Style:
  - Clean, technical but not cold
  - Professional but approachable
  - Reference: Stripe product videos (clean UI demos)

**Transition to Next Scene**:
Dashboard established → zoom into specific feature demo
Natural progression from "what it is" to "how it works"
```

### Bad Scene Description

```markdown
Scene 3 (15-25s)

Copy: "One dashboard"

Visual: Show the product

Notes: Make it look good

[Why it fails: Too vague, no context, motion designer must guess
everything]
```

## Timing Specifications

### How to Specify Timing

**Good**:
```
Scene 1: Hook (0s - 5s, Duration: 5s)
Scene 2: Problem (5s - 15s, Duration: 10s)
Scene 3: Solution (15s - 30s, Duration: 15s)
```

Clear start, end, duration. Easy to understand.

**Bad**:
```
Scene 1: About 5 seconds
Scene 2: Then another 10-ish seconds
Scene 3: Rest of the video
```

Vague, hard to plan.

### Timing Flexibility

Indicate where timing is flexible vs fixed:

```
Scene 4: Demo (20s - 35s, Duration: 15s)
  [Timing: FLEXIBLE - can adjust ±3s if needed for pacing]

Scene 8: CTA (85s - 90s, Duration: 5s)
  [Timing: FIXED - must end at 90s total]
```

## Psychology and Objection Notes

Include viewer psychology and objection handling:

### Good Example

```
**Viewer Psychology**:
At this point, viewers are thinking "this looks interesting but is it
too complicated for my team?" We need to address this directly without
stating it explicitly.

**Objection Handling**:
Complexity concern. Show the interface with minimal UI, emphasize
"5-minute setup" copy, and use social proof from non-technical role
("Even our sales team uses it daily" - VP Sales, CompanyX)
```

### Why This Matters

Motion designer can make visual choices that support the psychology:
- Simple, clean visuals to counter complexity fears
- Emphasize ease-of-use visually
- Choose testimonial that speaks to accessibility

## Copy Hierarchy

Make text hierarchy crystal clear:

```markdown
**On-Screen Copy**:
---
PRIMARY (largest, main focus):
"One dashboard. Every platform."

SECONDARY (supporting):
"Real attribution across all your ads"

TERTIARY (detail, fine print):
"Connect Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and 12+ platforms"
---
```

## Visual Style Direction

Provide style direction without dictating techniques:

### Good Style Direction

```markdown
**Visual Style**:
- Clean and modern, not overly designed
- Technical enough to be credible, accessible enough to be approachable
- Color palette: Cool (blues, grays) with warm accent (orange) for CTAs
- Reference: Notion product videos - clean, minimal, friendly

**Avoid**:
- Corporate/cold (too much blue/gray)
- Overly playful (we're B2B, not B2C kids product)
- Busy/cluttered (defeats our "simplicity" message)
```

### Bad Style Direction

```markdown
**Visual Style**:
Use After Effects effect #47 with interpolation set to ease-in-out
cubic bezier at frames 30-45 with damping of 200.

[Why it fails: This is HOW to execute, not WHAT style to achieve.
Let motion designer choose techniques.]
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

Include any platform requirements:

```markdown
## Platform Requirements

**LinkedIn Feed**:
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square)
- Must work without sound (60%+ watch muted)
- Text must be large, readable on mobile
- Avoid tiny UI details (won't be visible)

**YouTube Pre-roll**:
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- First 5s is unskippable, make it count
- CTA at end with verbal reinforcement

**Website Hero**:
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- Autoplay, muted, loops
- No time limit, can be longer
```

## Revision and Feedback Process

Include in handoff document:

```markdown
## Review Process

**First Review** (Storyboard):
- Team reviews this storyboard script
- Approve messaging, timing, flow
- Due: [Date]

**Second Review** (Motion Design Spec):
- Motion designer creates detailed spec with technical details
- Review animation approach, visual style
- Due: [Date]

**Third Review** (First Cut):
- Review rendered video
- Feedback on execution
- Due: [Date]

**Final Delivery**:
- Due: [Date]
```
