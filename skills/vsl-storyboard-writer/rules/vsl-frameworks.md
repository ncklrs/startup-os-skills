## VSL Framework Applications

**Impact: HIGH**

Proven frameworks provide structure and ensure key conversion elements are included. Choose the right framework based on video length, audience awareness, and objective.

## Framework Selection Matrix

| Framework | Duration | Audience | Goal | Complexity |
|-----------|----------|----------|------|------------|
| **Hook-CTA** | 15-30s | Aware of problem | Click/visit | Simple |
| **PAS** | 30-90s | Problem-aware | Trial/demo | Medium |
| **AIDA** | 60-120s | Solution-aware | Purchase/signup | Medium |
| **The Explainer** | 60-180s | Unaware | Education + action | Medium-High |
| **VSL Classic** | 3-10min | Cold traffic | Direct sale | High |

## Hook-CTA (15-30s Social Ads)

**Formula**: Problem Hook → Quick Solution Demo → Clear CTA

### Structure

```
Hook (0-20%): 3-6s
  - Bold problem statement or question
  - Visual: Show pain point

Solution (20-70%): 6-21s
  - Quick demo or transformation
  - 1-2 key benefits
  - Visual: Product in action

CTA (70-100%): 21-30s
  - Clear next step
  - Remove friction
  - Visual: Button/link with value
```

### Good Example (30s LinkedIn Ad)

```
Scene 1: Hook (0-5s)
On-Screen: "Sales team using 12 different tools?"
Visual: Desktop with 12 app windows open, chaotic
Psychology: Problem recognition

Scene 2: Solution Intro (5-12s)
On-Screen: "One platform. Everything connected."
Visual: All apps collapse into one clean interface
Psychology: Relief, simplicity appeal

Scene 3: Key Benefit (12-22s)
On-Screen: "Close deals 2x faster"
Visual: Sales dashboard showing won deals
Psychology: Specific outcome, aspirational

Scene 4: CTA (22-30s)
On-Screen: "Start free trial • No credit card"
Visual: Simple form, 2 fields visible
Psychology: Low friction, risk-free
```

### Bad Example
```
0-10s: Company history and mission
10-20s: Feature list (no demo)
20-30s: Generic "Learn more" CTA

Why it fails:
- No hook (loses viewers immediately)
- Tell instead of show
- Vague CTA with no value
```

## PAS Framework (30-90s)

**Formula**: Problem → Agitate → Solution

Most effective for cold traffic and problem-aware audiences.

### Structure

```
Problem (0-25%): 9-23s
  - Identify specific pain point
  - Make it personal ("You")
  - Visual: Show the struggle

Agitate (25-50%): 23-45s
  - Why it's getting worse
  - Cost of inaction
  - Failed alternatives
  - Visual: Amplify frustration

Solution (50-100%): 45-90s
  - Introduce product
  - Show it working
  - Key benefits
  - Social proof
  - Clear CTA
  - Visual: Transformation
```

### Good Example (60s Product Video)

### When to Use PAS

- Product is reactive (solves existing pain vs creates new desire)

- Selling to solution-aware audience (they know options exist)
- Novel product with no clear problem (use curiosity instead)
- Sophisticated audience that resents manipulation

## Framework Customization Rules

1. **Lengthen the proof section** if trust is the main barrier
2. **Extend the demo** if product is visually compelling
3. **Shorten problem agitation** if audience is solution-aware
4. **Add urgency** only if it's genuine (launch, limited spots, etc.)

## Hybrid Frameworks

Sometimes combine frameworks:

### PAS + Social Proof Heavy
```
Problem (0-20%)
Agitate (20-35%)
Solution (35-50%)
Proof (50-80%) ← Extended proof section
CTA (80-100%)

Use when: Trust is the main barrier
```

### AIDA + Story
```
Story Hook (0-10%)
Attention (10-20%)
Interest (20-40%)
Desire (40-80%)
Action (80-100%)

Use when: Emotional connection is key
```
