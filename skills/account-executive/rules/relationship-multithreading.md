## Multi-Threading and Relationship Building

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Single-threaded deals die. Your champion leaves, gets reassigned, loses influence, or simply can't navigate internal politics alone. Multi-threading isn't optional — it's survival.

### Why Deals Die Single-Threaded

| Risk | Probability | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Champion leaves company | 20%/year | Deal dies |
| Champion changes role | 15%/year | Deal stalls |
| Champion loses influence | Common | Competitor wins |
| Champion can't navigate politics | Very common | Deal stuck |
| Stakeholder surprise | Common | Deal restarts |

**The Math:**
- Single-threaded deal: 15% win rate
- 3+ threads: 30% win rate
- 5+ threads (including EB): 45% win rate

### The Multi-Threading Matrix

Map every opportunity against this matrix:

```
                    INFLUENCE
                Low          High
           ┌────────────┬────────────┐
    High   │ MOBILIZER  │   POWER    │
           │ Coach them │  Win them  │
 SUPPORT   │ to sell    │  Game over │
           ├────────────┼────────────┤
    Low    │  NEUTRAL   │  BLOCKER   │
           │ Convert or │ Neutralize │
           │ ignore     │ or remove  │
           └────────────┴────────────┘
```

### Stakeholder Personas

| Persona | Motivation | How to Engage | Warning Signs |
|---------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Economic Buyer** | ROI, strategic alignment, risk | Business outcomes, executive credibility | Inaccessible, delegates everything |
| **Technical Buyer** | Works, integrates, secure | Technical deep-dives, POC, documentation | Raises endless objections |
| **User Buyer** | Easy to use, solves their pain | Workflow demos, testimonials | "We're fine with current tool" |
| **Champion** | Career advancement, recognition | Enable them, make them look good | Going dark, hedging language |
| **Coach** | Helps you win (may not buy) | Information, org mapping | Not providing real intel |

### Building Threads: The Expansion Playbook

**Method 1: Champion Introduction**
```
"Sarah, to build the strongest possible business case, I'd love
to understand IT's security requirements. Could you introduce me
to your counterpart in security? I want to make sure we're
addressing their concerns early so they don't slow us down later."
```

**Method 2: The Executive Brief**
```
"I've been working with Sarah's team for a few weeks and we've
identified some compelling use cases. Given the strategic nature
of this initiative, I'd love to share an executive summary with
[CRO name] — even 15 minutes would help me understand his priorities
so our proposal aligns perfectly."
```

**Method 3: The Reference Conversation**
```
"We work with [similar company]. Their [same title as target]
found our quarterly business review process valuable. Would your
[target title] be interested in a peer conversation about how
they're approaching [relevant challenge]?"
```

**Method 4: The Event/Content Hook**
```
"We're hosting an executive roundtable on [relevant topic] with
leaders from [impressive companies]. Given [target executive's]
background in this area, I thought they might find the conversation
valuable. Can you make an introduction?"
```

### Thread Quality Checklist

For each contact, validate:

| Dimension | Question | Yes/No |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Relevance** | Do they influence or make this decision? | |
| **Access** | Can you reach them directly? | |
| **Engagement** | Have they responded/met with you? | |
| **Support** | Are they favorable to your solution? | |
| **Information** | Do they share useful intel? | |

**Strong Thread:** 4-5 yes
**Moderate Thread:** 2-3 yes
**Weak Thread:** 0-1 yes (not really a thread)

### Multi-Threading by Deal Stage

| Stage | Minimum Threads | Key Contacts |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Discovery** | 1-2 | Champion + one other |
| **Scoping** | 3+ | Champion + Technical + User |
| **Validation** | 4+ | Add Economic Buyer |
| **Proposal** | 5+ | Add Procurement, Legal |
| **Closing** | All mapped | All decision-makers engaged |

### Relationship Depth Levels

```
Level 5: TRUSTED ADVISOR
- They seek your advice proactively
- You have direct access anytime
- They share confidential information
- They advocate for you publicly

Level 4: BUSINESS PARTNER
- Regular strategic conversations
- They introduce you to stakeholders
- They share internal priorities
- They respond quickly

Level 3: VENDOR
- Transactional relationship
- Meetings when scheduled
- Professional but limited
- They take your calls

Level 2: ACQUAINTANCE
- Know each other
- Occasional interaction
- No real relationship
- Email only

Level 1: STRANGER
- No relationship
- Cold outreach required
```

### The "Safe" Introduction Framework

Help champions make introductions without risk:

```
"Sarah, I know introducing a vendor to your VP can feel risky.
Here's how I'd suggest positioning it:

'David, I've been evaluating solutions for [problem]. I've found
one that could help us achieve [specific outcome]. Before I invest
more time, I wanted to get your input on whether this aligns with
your priorities for Q3. Could you spare 15 minutes?'

This way, you're asking for guidance, not selling. And if he's
not interested, it's on me, not you. Does that approach work?"
```

### Mapping the Organization

Create a power map for every Tier 1 deal:

```
                           CEO
                            |
              ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
              |             |             |
            CFO           CRO           CTO
             |             |             |
         Controller    VP Sales      VP Eng
                          |             |
                    [CHAMPION]      Architect
                      |                |
                    Team Lead    [TECHNICAL]
                                   BUYER
```

Mark each contact:
- GREEN: Supporter
- YELLOW: Neutral
- RED: Blocker
- CIRCLE: Economic Buyer
- STAR: Champion

### Anti-Patterns

- **Champion dependence** — Only talking to one person
- **Avoiding executives** — "My champion will handle it"
- **Thread hoarding** — Not sharing contacts with team
- **Fake threads** — Counting people you've met once
- **Skipping levels** — Going to CEO without champion support
- **Ignoring blockers** — Hoping they'll go away
- **Late multi-threading** — Starting at proposal stage
