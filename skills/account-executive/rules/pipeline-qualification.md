## Pipeline Qualification and Prioritization

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Your pipeline is not a list of companies that will buy. It's a ranked list of opportunities that deserve your time. Ruthless qualification separates top performers from everyone else.

### The Qualification Mindset

**Every minute spent on a bad deal is stolen from a good one.**

| Top Performer | Average Performer |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Qualifies out fast | Holds on hoping |
| 25% win rate on smaller pipeline | 15% win rate on bloated pipeline |
| Forecasts accurately | Surprised by losses |
| Creates urgency | Waits for customer |
| Multi-threads early | Scrambles late |

### MEDDPICC Deep Dive

#### Metrics (M)
**Question:** What business outcomes will this solve, and how will success be measured?

**Good Example:**
```
"Sarah, you mentioned reducing time-to-close from 45 days to 30 days.
At your current deal volume of 200/quarter, that's 3,000 extra selling days
annually. What's each selling day worth to your org?"

Champion: "Each rep day is roughly $2,500 in influenced revenue."

"So we're looking at potential $7.5M in influenced revenue annually.
Is that the kind of impact that gets budget approved?"
```

**Bad Example:**
```
"So you want to improve sales efficiency?"
Champion: "Yes, definitely."
"Great, our tool helps with that."
```

#### Economic Buyer (EB)
**Question:** Who can authorize this budget without needing approval?

| EB Access Level | What It Means | Action Required |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Direct access** | You've met them, they're engaged | Maintain relationship |
| **Champion-mediated** | Champion briefs EB, reports back | Coach champion, request intro |
| **Unknown** | Don't know who EB is | Disqualify or map org |
| **Blocked** | Champion won't introduce you | Major red flag |

**Good Example:**
```
"Jennifer, for a project of this scope ($150K), who ultimately
signs off on the budget? I want to make sure we're addressing
their priorities, not just the team's."

Champion: "That would be our CRO, Marcus. He approves anything over $100K."

"Perfect. What matters most to Marcus right now? I'd love to
understand how this fits into his priorities before we present
the business case."
```

**Bad Example:**
```
"Who's the decision maker?"
Champion: "Oh, we make decisions as a team."
"Great, so you can approve this?"
```

#### Identified Pain (I)
**Question:** Why does this need to be solved NOW, not next quarter?

**Pain Intensity Scale:**

| Level | Indicator | Close Probability |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | Business at risk, deadline-driven, executive mandate | High |
| **Significant** | Measurable cost, competitive pressure, growth blocked | Medium-High |
| **Moderate** | Inefficiency, frustration, nice-to-have improvement | Medium |
| **Low** | Curiosity, exploring options, no urgency | Low |

**Good Example:**
```
"Help me understand the urgency. You mentioned losing three deals
to CompetitorX this quarter because of slow implementation times.
What happens if this doesn't get solved by Q3?"

Champion: "Honestly, we'll probably miss our annual revenue target
by $2M, and my VP is already under pressure from the board."

"That's significant. Is this project officially prioritized, or
are we competing with other initiatives for budget?"
```

**Bad Example:**
```
"So you're looking to improve operations?"
Champion: "Yes, we always want to be more efficient."
"Perfect, let me show you our demo."
```

### Qualification Scoring Matrix

Score each opportunity 1-5 on these dimensions:

| Dimension | 1 (Poor) | 3 (Average) | 5 (Strong) |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Pain** | Nice-to-have | Some urgency | Business-critical |
| **Champion** | Contact only | Interested advocate | Active internal seller |
| **EB Access** | Unknown | Indirect | Direct relationship |
| **Timeline** | "Someday" | This year | This quarter |
| **Budget** | Unknown | Identified | Allocated |
| **Competition** | Unknown | 3+ vendors | You're preferred |

**Score Interpretation:**
- 25-30: Tier 1 - Maximum effort
- 20-24: Tier 2 - High priority
- 15-19: Tier 3 - Monitor and nurture
- <15: Disqualify or deprioritize

### Disqualification Criteria

**Hard Disqualifiers (Walk Away):**
- No budget and no path to budget
- Wrong ICP (can't succeed with your product)
- Champion has no influence
- 12+ month timeline with no compelling event
- Competitor already selected (fake RFP)

**Soft Disqualifiers (Proceed with Caution):**
- Single-threaded with no path to multi-thread
- No clear pain quantified
- Procurement complexity exceeds deal value
- Champion is too junior
- Technical requirements misaligned

### Pipeline Hygiene Cadence

| Activity | Frequency | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Deal review** | Weekly | Update stage, identify blockers |
| **Qualification audit** | Bi-weekly | Score all deals, disqualify weak ones |
| **Pipeline scrub** | Monthly | Remove stale deals, update forecasts |
| **Win/loss review** | After each close | Learn and adjust qualification |

### Good vs. Bad Pipeline

**Good Pipeline:**
```
12 Opportunities
- 4 at Discovery (40% of coverage) - actively qualifying
- 3 at Scoping (25% of coverage) - clear requirements
- 3 at Validation (20% of coverage) - EB engaged
- 2 at Proposal (15% of coverage) - negotiating terms

4x coverage, high confidence on 50%+ stage deals
```

**Bad Pipeline:**
```
30 Opportunities
- 20 at Discovery - many stale, hope-based
- 6 at Scoping - stuck, no next steps
- 3 at Validation - single-threaded
- 1 at Proposal - competitor emerged

"4x coverage" but really 1.5x of real deals
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Pipeline vanity** — Large pipeline with low win rates
- **Qualification procrastination** — Avoiding hard questions early
- **Champion-only validation** — Not testing with other stakeholders
- **Hope forecasting** — "They seemed interested"
- **Sunk cost fallacy** — Continuing because you've invested time
- **RFP addiction** — Chasing every RFP without qualification
