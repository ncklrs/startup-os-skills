## Journalist Relationship Building

**Impact: HIGH**

The best PR doesn't come from pitching—it comes from being the person journalists call when they need a source. Relationships are built before you need them.

### The Relationship Spectrum

| Level | Characteristics | Your Value to Them |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Cold** | Never interacted | None yet |
| **Warm** | Engaged with their content | Audience member |
| **Connected** | Exchanged messages | Potential source |
| **Trusted** | Provided useful info/sources | Reliable resource |
| **Go-to** | They reach out proactively | Expert on speed dial |

### The 10:1 Value Ratio

For every pitch you send, provide 10 value-adds:

| Value-Add | Example | Effort |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Share their article | Thoughtful LinkedIn share with commentary | Low |
| Send relevant tip | "Saw this, thought of your beat" | Low |
| Make introduction | Connect them to a source they need | Medium |
| Respond to requests | HARO, Twitter asks, source requests | Medium |
| Provide background | Off-record context for their story | Medium |
| Early access | Let them try products before launch | Medium |
| Exclusive data | Share research before it's public | High |
| Source for others | Connect when you're not the story | High |

### Building Relationships Before You Need Them

```
Timeline: 3-6 months before you have news

Month 1-2:
├── Identify 20-30 journalists covering your space
├── Follow them on Twitter/LinkedIn
├── Read their recent articles (actually read them)
└── Start engaging genuinely with their content

Month 2-3:
├── Share their work with thoughtful commentary
├── Respond to source requests (even if not for you)
├── Send occasional tips without asking for anything
└── Begin light DM/email conversations

Month 3-6:
├── Offer to be a background source
├── Make introductions to people they should know
├── Build genuine rapport around shared interests
└── You're now someone they recognize and might respond to
```

### Good Relationship Building

```
✓ "Saw your thread on AI governance—this Senate hearing transcript
   might be useful for your next piece. No need to credit, just
   thought you'd want to see it."
   → Provides value, no ask, shows you pay attention

✓ "Re: your request for CISO sources—I'm not the right fit but my
   friend [Name] at [Company] deals with this daily. Want an intro?"
   → Helpful even when you can't benefit

✓ "Your piece on [topic] changed how I think about [X]. Specifically
   [detailed observation]. Looking forward to the follow-up you
   mentioned."
   → Shows genuine engagement, not just flattery
```

### Bad Relationship Building

```
✗ "Loved your article! Would you like to write about my company?"
   → Transparent flattery-to-pitch pipeline

✗ "I've been following your work for years..." [first interaction]
   → Obvious lie, credibility destroyed

✗ "Let me know if I can ever be helpful" [no specific offer]
   → Vague, puts burden on them

✗ Liking every tweet without ever adding substance
   → Looks automated, provides no value
```

### Journalist Communication Preferences

| Platform | Best For | Etiquette |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Email** | Formal pitches, detailed info | Professional, concise |
| **Twitter/X DM** | Quick tips, casual connection | Brief, low pressure |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional connection | Don't pitch immediately |
| **Signal/Text** | Breaking news, urgent tips | Only if relationship warrants |
| **In-person** | Events, conferences | Respect their time |

### The Background Source Strategy

Offering to be a "background source" builds trust without requiring coverage.

```
"I'm not pitching anything—just offering to be a background source
if you ever need context on [topic]. Happy to talk off the record
about industry dynamics, explain technical concepts, or point you
toward the right people to interview."
```

Benefits:
- Builds relationship without transaction
- Positions you as expert
- Creates natural opportunities for future coverage
- Journalists remember who helped them understand complex topics

### Responding to Source Requests

HARO (Help a Reporter Out), Twitter requests, and journalist queries:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Respond within hours, not days | Wait until it's no longer relevant |
| Answer exactly what's asked | Provide tangential information |
| Be quotable and specific | Give vague, hedge-filled responses |
| Include credentials briefly | Send full bio and company overview |
| Offer to elaborate if helpful | Demand to review quotes |

### Good Source Response

```
Subject: Re: Source needed: DevOps security trends

Hi Alex,

For your DevOps security piece:

Key insight: "The biggest shift we're seeing is secrets management
moving from 'we'll figure it out' to board-level concern. After the
CircleCI breach, every CISO I talk to has it on their 2024 priority
list."

Supporting data: 73% of our enterprise customers implemented secrets
rotation in 2023, up from 31% in 2022.

Happy to elaborate or provide customer references if helpful.

[Name], CEO @ Acme (YC '22, ex-Google Security)

### Maintaining Relationships After Coverage

| Timing | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Same day** | Thank them (not effusively, professionally) |
| **Same week** | Share the article with your audience, tag them |
| **Ongoing** | Continue providing value unrelated to your company |
| **Never** | Ask them to change something after publication |

### Relationship Tracking

Maintain a simple system:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Name | Journalist name |
| Outlet | Current publication |
| Beat | What they cover |
| Last interaction | When you last connected |
| Notes | Personal details, preferences |
| Relationship level | Cold/Warm/Connected/Trusted |
| Next action | What value can you provide? |

### When Journalists Move

Journalists change jobs frequently. When they do:

```
✓ "Congrats on the new role at [outlet]! Looking forward to your
   coverage there. Let me know if I can ever be useful on
   [relevant topic]."
   → Brief, genuine, maintains relationship

✗ "Now that you're at [bigger outlet], would you be interested in
   covering [your company]?"
   → Opportunistic, obvious motive
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Transactional only** — Only reaching out when you need something
- **Fake familiarity** — "It's been too long!" when you've never met
- **Guilt tripping** — "I've shared so much, can you cover us?"
- **Bridging to pitch** — Pretending to offer value, then pivoting to ask
- **Ignoring their beat** — Pitching AI to a healthcare writer
- **Public pressure** — Tagging journalists asking why they haven't covered you
- **Over-communication** — More than 1-2 touches per month without reason
- **Forgetting the human** — Journalists are people with interests beyond their beat
