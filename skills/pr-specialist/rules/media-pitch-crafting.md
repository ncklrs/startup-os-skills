## Media Pitch Crafting

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Journalists receive 50-200 pitches daily. Most get deleted in seconds. A great pitch earns a response in 3-5 seconds of scanning.

### Pitch Anatomy

| Component | Purpose | Character Limit |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Subject line** | Earn the open | 50-60 chars |
| **Hook** | Why you, why now | 1-2 sentences |
| **The story** | What's newsworthy | 2-3 sentences |
| **The ask** | What you want | 1 sentence |
| **Credentials** | Why you're credible | 1-2 sentences |
| **Sign-off** | Professional close | 1 sentence |

### Subject Line Formulas

| Formula | Example | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Exclusive offer** | "Exclusive: First look at [X]" | Tier 1, breaking news |
| **Data hook** | "New data: 73% of CISOs say [X]" | Research, trends |
| **Timely tie-in** | "For your [event] coverage: [angle]" | News cycle, events |
| **Contrarian** | "The case against [popular thing]" | Opinion, trend pieces |
| **Question** | "Why are VCs suddenly backing [X]?" | Trend stories |
| **Name drop** | "[Notable person] joins [company]" | Executive news |

### Good Subject Lines

```
✓ "Exclusive: Stripe-backed startup launches open-source Plaid alternative"
  → Exclusive flag, notable backer, clear differentiation

✓ "For your AI coverage: Why 80% of enterprise AI projects fail (new data)"
  → Beat-relevant, specific stat, fresh data

✓ "Quick question about your secrets management piece"
  → Personal, references their work, low commitment

✓ "Source: Ex-Google engineer on why LLMs can't replace search"
  → Expert source, contrarian angle, timely topic
```

### Bad Subject Lines

```
✗ "Press Release: Acme Inc. Announces New Product"
  → Screams "mass pitch," no news value

✗ "Following up on my previous email"
  → No reason to open, no new value

✗ "URGENT: Major news from Acme"
  → Fake urgency destroys trust

✗ "Partnership Opportunity"
  → Sounds like spam, vague
```

### The 3-Sentence Pitch

```
[Hook - why this matters to their readers]
[The story - what's happening, with proof point]
[The ask - specific, easy to say yes to]
```

### Good Pitch Example

```
Subject: For your fintech beat: YC startup replacing SWIFT for B2B payments

Hi Sarah,

Your recent piece on cross-border payment friction resonated with our
customers—we've heard the same complaints from 200+ finance teams.

We just closed $15M from Andreessen to build SWIFT's replacement for B2B.
Our beta users (including Notion and Linear) are seeing 3-day payments
become same-day at 70% lower fees.

Would our CEO be helpful for your payments infrastructure coverage? Happy
to share customer data and early access.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Bad Pitch Example

```
Subject: Press Release: Acme Revolutionizes Payments

Dear Journalist,

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to reach out to share some
exciting news about Acme, the leading provider of innovative payment
solutions for the modern enterprise.

Acme is thrilled to announce the launch of our revolutionary new
platform that leverages cutting-edge technology to transform the
payments landscape. Our solution offers best-in-class features and
unparalleled customer service.

I've attached our press release for your convenience. Please let me
know if you'd like to schedule an interview with our CEO to discuss
this exciting announcement.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best regards,
[Name]
```

### What's Wrong With the Bad Example

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Generic greeting | Use their name |
| "Hope this finds you well" | Delete it |
| No hook to their beat | Reference recent work |
| Buzzwords (revolutionary, innovative) | Specific claims |
| "Leading provider" without proof | Credibility via numbers |
| "Attached press release" | Key info in email body |
| No specific ask | Clear, easy next step |
| No reason to respond now | Timely hook |

### Personalization That Works

| Level | Example | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **None** | "Dear Journalist" | Deleted immediately |
| **Name only** | "Hi Sarah" | Still feels mass |
| **Beat mention** | "For your fintech coverage" | Better, shows research |
| **Article reference** | "Your piece on [X] resonated" | Shows genuine reading |
| **Insight addition** | "Building on your [X] thesis..." | High effort, high response |

### Follow-Up Cadence

| Touch | Timing | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Initial pitch** | Day 0 | Full pitch |
| **Follow-up 1** | Day 3-4 | New angle or data point |
| **Follow-up 2** | Day 7-8 | Different hook, same story |
| **Move on** | Day 10+ | Add to nurture, try later |

### Good Follow-Up

```
Subject: Re: For your fintech beat: YC startup replacing SWIFT

Hi Sarah,

Quick update since my last note—we just crossed 500 customers and
processed our millionth transaction.

If the SWIFT angle doesn't fit, I've also got a customer (CFO of
Linear) who can speak to hidden costs of cross-border payments.

Either useful for upcoming coverage?

Best,
[Name]
```

### Bad Follow-Up

```
✗ "Just checking in to see if you got my email"
  → Provides zero new value

✗ "I know you're busy, but..."
  → Apologetic, wastes words

✗ "Bumping this to the top of your inbox"
  → Presumptuous, annoying

✗ Forwarding original email with "?"
  → Lazy, signals desperation
```

### Pitch Timing Matrix

| Journalist Type | Best Pitch Window | Avoid |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Daily news** | 6-9am their time | After noon |
| **Weekly publication** | Monday-Tuesday | Thursday-Friday |
| **Freelance** | Varies, test | Mass pitch times |
| **Podcast host** | Weekday mornings | When recording |

### The "Not For Me" Response

When a journalist says it's not for them:

```
✓ "Totally understand. Anyone on your team who might be a better fit
   for dev tools coverage?"
   → Asks for referral politely

✓ "Thanks for letting me know. Is there a different angle on
   [topic] that would be more relevant to your readers?"
   → Learns their needs

✗ "But this is really big news that your readers need to know about"
   → Argumentative, burns bridge
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Mass BCC pitches** — Obvious, disrespectful, ineffective
- **Attaching press release** — Key info should be in email body
- **"Per my last email"** — Passive aggressive, relationship killer
- **Pitching the wrong beat** — Security story to a fintech writer
- **No specific ask** — What do you actually want them to do?
- **Burying the hook** — News in paragraph 3
- **Over-following up** — More than 2-3 follow-ups is harassment
- **Pitch during breaking news** — Check the news before hitting send
