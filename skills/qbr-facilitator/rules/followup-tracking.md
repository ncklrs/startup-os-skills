## Follow-up & Action Tracking

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

The QBR isn't over when the meeting ends — it's over when the actions are complete. Follow-up is where QBRs succeed or fail. 80% of QBR value is lost through poor follow-through. The best CSMs close the loop relentlessly.

### Follow-up Timeline

### Good Follow-up Practices

```
✓ Same-day summary
  → Send within 24 hours (ideally same day)
  → While details are fresh
  → Shows professionalism and commitment

✓ Clear action ownership
  → Named owner for every item
  → Both sides have commitments
  → Specific due dates, not "soon"

✓ Regular progress tracking
  → Weekly internal tracking
  → Bi-weekly customer check-ins
  → Visible progress updates

✓ Proactive communication
  → Don't wait for customer to ask
  → Provide updates before due dates
  → Flag blockers early

✓ Complete before next QBR
  → All actions resolved or explained
  → Demonstrate reliability
  → Build trust through execution
```

### Bad Follow-up Practices

```
✗ Delayed or missing summary
  → Week later: "Sorry, been busy..."
  → Customer loses confidence
  → Details become fuzzy

✗ Vague action items
  → "Improve adoption"
  → "Follow up on that thing"
  → No clarity on what done looks like

✗ Unilateral commitments
  → All actions on vendor, none on customer
  → Or vice versa
  → Need mutual accountability

✗ Set and forget
  → Capture actions, never track
  → Arrive at next QBR with nothing done
  → Trust destroyed

✗ Silent failures
  → Miss deadlines without communication
  → Customer surprised by non-delivery
  → Always communicate early
```

    Not: "The team"

R - RELEVANT
    Why does this matter?

    Connected to outcomes

T - TIME-BOUND
    When is it due?
    "By [Specific Date]"
    Not: "ASAP" or "Q4"

### Handling Incomplete Actions

```
## When Actions Aren't Done

VENDOR ACTIONS NOT COMPLETE

1. Communicate Early
   "I wanted to let you know we're behind on [action].
   Here's why and here's our new plan..."

2. Own the Miss
   Don't make excuses
   Acknowledge impact on customer

3. Provide New Commitment
   Specific new date
   Additional resources if needed

4. Document for QBR
   Be transparent about what happened
   Show corrective actions

CUSTOMER ACTIONS NOT COMPLETE

1. Inquire, Don't Accuse
   "How's [action] progressing?"
   "Is there anything blocking you?"

2. Understand the Barrier
   Resource constraints?
   Priority shift?
   Need help?

3. Offer Support
   "Would it help if we...?"
   "Can I provide anything to make this easier?"

4. Adjust if Needed
   Maybe the action wasn't realistic
   Revise and recommit
```

### Pre-Next-QBR Review

```
## Pre-QBR Action Review Checklist

□ All Actions Reviewed
  □ Status updated for all items
  □ Completed items documented
  □ Incomplete items have explanations

□ Outstanding Items

```

### Follow-up Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Summary Delivery** | Hours to send QBR summary | <24 hours |
| **Action Completion Rate** | Actions completed on time | >80% |
| **Overdue Rate** | Actions past due date | <10% |
| **Check-in Cadence** | Days between progress reviews | Every 2 weeks |
| **Carryover Rate** | Actions carried to next QBR | <5% |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Summary delay** — Sending summary a week later
- **Vague actions** — "Follow up on things"
- **No tracking system** — Actions captured but not managed
- **One-sided accountability** — Only vendor or customer has actions
- **Silent failures** — Missing deadlines without communication
- **Same actions every QBR** — Never complete, always carry forward
- **No check-ins** — Wait until next QBR to review progress
- **Blame shifting** — Customer didn't do their part (as excuse)
