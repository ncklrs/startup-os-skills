## YouTube Strategy

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

YouTube is the second largest search engine. Content here compounds for years, not hours.

### Why YouTube for B2B

- **Search intent:** People actively looking for solutions
- **Longevity:** Videos rank and get views for years
- **Depth:** Room for tutorials, explanations, demos
- **Trust:** Long-form builds deeper trust
- **Multiple formats:** Long-form, Shorts, podcasts

### YouTube Algorithm 2024/2025

**What gets recommended:**
- Watch time (total minutes watched)
- Click-through rate (thumbnail + title)
- Audience retention (% of video watched)
- Session time (do they keep watching?)
- Engagement (likes, comments, subscribes)

**What kills growth:**
- Low CTR (bad thumbnail/title)
- High bounce rate (misleading title)
- Poor retention (boring or slow)
- Inconsistent posting

### Content Types for B2B SaaS

| Type | Length | Best For | Frequency |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Tutorial** | 5-15 min | SEO, product education | Weekly |
| **Thought leadership** | 10-20 min | Trust, authority | Weekly |
| **Product demo** | 3-10 min | Bottom of funnel | Monthly |
| **Podcast/Interview** | 30-60 min | Reach, networking | Weekly |
| **Shorts** | < 60 sec | Discovery, reach | Daily |

### The Title Formula

**Pattern: [Outcome/Problem] + [Specificity] + [Curiosity]**

```
Good:
"How We Manage 10,000 Secrets Without Losing Sleep"
"The Security Mistake That Almost Killed Our Startup"
"Secrets Management in 2025: What Actually Works"

Bad:
"SecretStash Product Demo"
"How to Use Our Tool"
"Thoughts on Security"
```

### Thumbnail Principles

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Text** | 3-5 words max, readable at small size |
| **Face** | Human faces increase CTR |
| **Contrast** | Bright colors, stands out in feed |
| **Consistency** | Recognizable style across videos |
| **Emotion** | Expression that matches content |

### Video Structure

```
0:00-0:30   HOOK
            - Promise what they'll learn
            - Why it matters to them
            - "By the end of this video, you'll..."

0:30-1:00   INTRO
            - Quick credibility (why you)
            - Overview of structure
            - "Subscribe if you're into X"

1:00-X:00   CONTENT
            - Deliver on promise
            - Use pattern interrupts every 2-3 min
            - Show, don't just tell

X:00-X:30   RECAP + CTA
            - Summarize key points
            - Clear next step
            - Mention related video
```

### YouTube Shorts Strategy

**Shorts feed long-form growth:**
- Teaser clips from long videos
- Standalone tips (same topics)
- Trending topics + your expertise

**Short structure:**
```
0:00-0:02   HOOK (stop scroll)
0:02-0:45   VALUE (one point)
0:45-0:58   CTA or LOOP
```

**Optimal:** 30-45 seconds for highest retention

### SEO for YouTube

| Element | Optimization |
|---------|--------------|
| **Title** | Primary keyword near front |
| **Description** | First 150 chars matter, include keywords |
| **Tags** | 5-10 relevant tags |
| **Chapters** | Timestamps improve watch time |
| **Transcript** | Upload or auto-generate |
| **Thumbnail** | Not SEO, but affects CTR which affects ranking |

### Publishing Cadence

| Approach | Long-form | Shorts |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Minimum** | 1/week | 3/week |
| **Growth** | 2/week | Daily |
| **Scale** | 3+/week | Daily |

**Consistency > quantity.** Weekly on the same day beats random.
