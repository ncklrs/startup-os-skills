## Virality & Distribution

**Impact: MEDIUM**

Virality isn't luck — it's engineering shareability into your content and product.

### Virality Types

| Type | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Inherent** | Product requires sharing | Slack, Figma (collaborate) |
| **Word of mouth** | So good people tell others | Notion, Linear |
| **Incentivized** | Rewards for sharing | Dropbox (free space) |
| **Content** | Content gets shared | Tweets, videos, memes |
| **Outrage** | Controversial/emotional | Hot takes (use carefully) |

### The Viral Coefficient

```
K = i × c

i = invites per user
c = conversion rate of invites

K > 1 = exponential growth
K = 1 = stable
K < 1 = need other channels
```

**Example:**
- Each user invites 3 teammates (i = 3)
- 40% of invites convert (c = 0.4)
- K = 3 × 0.4 = 1.2 (viral growth!)

### Engineering Product Virality

**Built-in sharing:**
- Collaboration requires invites
- Shared workspaces/projects
- Team features drive expansion

**Visible to others:**
- "Made with X" badges
- Public profiles/pages
- Shareable outputs

**Status/identity:**
- Users want to show they use it
- Badges, certificates
- "Powered by" bragging rights

### Content Virality Triggers

| Trigger | How It Works | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Utility** | So useful, must share | Checklists, templates, tools |
| **Identity** | Makes me look good sharing | Thought leadership, opinions |
| **Emotion** | Strong feeling (humor, awe, anger) | Stories, memes, takes |
| **Currency** | New/insider information | Data, scoops, predictions |
| **Story** | Narrative arc | Founder stories, failures |

### The Shareability Formula

**For every piece of content, ask:**

1. **Is it screenshot-able?**
   - Single image captures the value
   - Works out of context

2. **Does it make the sharer look good?**
   - "Look how smart I am sharing this"
   - Status signaling

3. **Is there a hook for a reaction?**
   - Agree/disagree
   - Add your experience
   - Tag someone

4. **Is it timely?**
   - Riding a trend
   - Reacting to news

### Distribution Stack

**Don't just publish — distribute:**

```
Content Created
      │
      ├── Post on primary platform
      ├── Cross-post to secondary platforms
      ├── Share in relevant communities
      ├── Email to subscribers
      ├── Share in Slack/Discord groups
      ├── DM to relevant people
      ├── Ping for shares/retweets
      └── Repurpose in 7 days
```

### Community Distribution

**Where your ICP hangs out:**

| Channel | Type | Rules |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Hacker News** | Link submission | Titles matter, no marketing speak |
| **Reddit** | Community posts | Be helpful, not promotional |
| **Product Hunt** | Product launches | Timing + community matters |
| **Indie Hackers** | Founder stories | Transparency wins |
| **Dev.to** | Developer content | Technical + helpful |
| **Discord/Slack groups** | Niche communities | Give before you take |

### Launch Distribution Checklist

```
□ Email list announcement
□ Social posts (all platforms)
□ Product Hunt launch
□ Hacker News submission
□ Reddit (relevant subs)
□ Community posts (Discord, Slack)
□ Influencer outreach
□ Press/blogger outreach
□ Customer asks (share, upvote)
□ Team amplification
□ Investor/advisor shares
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Spray and pray** — Posting link everywhere without context
- **Ignoring communities** — Only broadcasting, not participating
- **One and done** — Single launch moment vs ongoing distribution
- **Fake virality** — Buying shares/upvotes (gets you banned)
- **All content, no distribution** — "Build it and they will come"
