## TikTok Strategy

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

TikTok isn't just for B2C. B2B founders are building audiences here, and decision-makers are younger every year.

### Why TikTok for B2B

- **Reach:** Algorithm serves content to non-followers
- **Demographics shifting:** Gen Z entering workforce, millennials in management
- **Less competition:** Most B2B companies aren't here yet
- **Long content shelf-life:** Videos resurface for weeks
- **Cross-platform:** TikToks perform well on Reels and Shorts

### TikTok Algorithm 2024/2025

**What gets reach:**
- Watch time (% of video watched)
- Rewatches (loop = gold)
- Shares and saves
- Comments
- Profile visits after watching

**What kills reach:**
- Skips in first 2 seconds
- Low completion rate
- Watermarks from other platforms
- Overly promotional content

### Content Formats That Work

| Format | Best For | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Talking head** | Hot takes, advice | "Nobody talks about this startup mistake" |
| **Screen share** | Tutorials, demos | "How to X in 30 seconds" |
| **Story time** | Engagement, trust | "How I lost $50k from one leaked API key" |
| **Trend + niche** | Reach | Trending audio + dev humor |
| **Day in life** | Personal brand | "What a startup founder's day actually looks like" |
| **Before/after** | Product demos | "Secrets management: before vs after" |

### The Hook (First 2 Seconds)

**Pattern:** Disrupt, promise, deliver

```
"Stop storing API keys in .env files"
(Disrupt: challenge current behavior)

"The tool that saved our startup $100k"
(Promise: big claim)

"POV: You just leaked production credentials"
(Relatable scenario)

"Most developers don't know this about secrets"
(Curiosity gap)
```

### Video Structure

```
0:00-0:02  HOOK (stop the scroll)
0:02-0:10  CONTEXT (why should I care?)
0:10-0:45  VALUE (deliver on promise)
0:45-0:55  CTA (follow, comment, check link)
0:55-1:00  LOOP POINT (connects back to hook)
```

### Optimal Video Length

| Length | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **15-30 sec** | Hot takes, quick tips |
| **30-60 sec** | Tutorials, explanations |
| **60-90 sec** | Story times, deeper content |
| **3+ min** | In-depth tutorials (lower reach, higher intent) |

### Posting Strategy

**Cadence:**
- Minimum: 3-5 videos/week
- Growth: 1-2 videos/day
- Best times: 9am, 12pm, 7pm (test for your audience)

**Batch production:**
- Film 10+ videos in one session
- Same setup, change shirt
- Edit in batches

### TikTok-Specific Tactics

**Use trending sounds:**
- Find trending audio in your niche
- Create your version with your expertise
- Check "Sounds" in discovery

**Stitch and Duet:**
- Stitch: React to first part of another video
- Duet: Side-by-side reaction/addition
- Great for building on trending content

**Hashtags that work:**
- 3-5 hashtags max
- Mix: 1 broad (#tech), 2 medium (#startups), 2 niche (#devsecops)
- Check hashtag views before using

### B2B TikTok Examples

**Morning Brew** — Business news, personality-driven
**Shopify** — Entrepreneur tips, success stories
**Notion** — Productivity tips, templates
**Individual founders** — Building in public, lessons

### Cross-Posting Strategy

```
TikTok (original)
    ↓
Instagram Reels (same day, no watermark)
    ↓
YouTube Shorts (next day, no watermark)
    ↓
LinkedIn (native upload, vertical format)
```

**Remove watermark before cross-posting** — Platforms penalize competitor watermarks

### Anti-Patterns

- **Over-produced** — TikTok rewards authentic over polished
- **Hard selling** — Entertainment first, product second
- **Ignoring trends** — Participating in trends expands reach
- **Same content as LinkedIn** — Platform-native content wins
- **No consistency** — Algorithm rewards regular posting
