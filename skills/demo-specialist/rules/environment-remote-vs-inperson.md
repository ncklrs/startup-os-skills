## Remote vs In-Person Demo Techniques

**Impact: HIGH**

Remote and in-person demos require fundamentally different approaches. What works in a conference room often fails over Zoom, and vice versa.

### Key Differences at a Glance

| Dimension | Remote | In-Person |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Attention span** | Shorter (10-15 min blocks) | Longer (20-30 min blocks) |
| **Engagement cues** | Limited (must ask) | Rich (body language) |
| **Technical control** | Full (your screen) | Variable (room setup) |
| **Relationship building** | Harder (intentional effort) | Natural (human presence) |
| **Follow-up materials** | Essential | Nice to have |
| **Multitasking risk** | High | Low |

### Remote Demo Best Practices

**The Remote Attention Challenge:**

```

      │   * *
      │  *   *     *
      │ *     *   * *
      │*       * *   *
Low   │        *       * * * * *
      └─────────────────────────────
      0    5    10   15   20   25   30
                    Minutes

Solution: Re-engage every 5-7 minutes
```

**Re-engagement Techniques:**

| Technique | Frequency | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Direct questions** | Every 5 min | "Sarah, does this match what you're seeing today?" |
| **Polls/reactions** | Every 10 min | "Thumbs up if this makes sense" |
| **Breakpoints** | Every 7 min | "Let me pause here — any questions so far?" |
| **Annotation** | As needed | "Let me highlight this..." |
| **Name usage** | Throughout | "Mike, this is what you asked about earlier" |

**Camera and Presence:**

```
DO:
□ Camera on (non-negotiable)
□ Look at camera when speaking, not screen
□ Smile and use facial expressions
□ Use hand gestures (visible in frame)
□ Vary vocal tone more than usual

DON'T:
□ Look at yourself in preview
□ Read from a script off-screen
□ Type/click without explaining
□ Go more than 60 seconds without engagement
```

**Remote Screen Sharing Tips:**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| They can't see detail | Zoom in, use annotation |
| Following is hard | Pause before/after transitions |
| Multiple screens confusing | Share single window, not desktop |
| Can't tell what you're doing | Narrate every action |
| Recording rules | Ask permission, confirm understanding |

### In-Person Demo Best Practices

**Room Setup Checklist:**

```
TECHNOLOGY
□ Adapter cables for room display
□ Backup laptop with demo ready
□ Confirm room A/V works
□ Test connection before meeting
□ Have mobile hotspot backup

POSITIONING
□ Stand if possible (more energy)
□ Face audience, not screen
□ Presenter can see screen without turning
□ All stakeholders can see clearly

MATERIALS
□ One-pager/leave-behind ready
□ Business cards
□ Notepad for their questions
□ Demo script (if needed)
```

**Physical Presence:**

| Element | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| **Standing vs sitting** | Stand when presenting, sit for discussion |
| **Movement** | Move with purpose, don't pace nervously |
| **Eye contact** | Rotate through all stakeholders |
| **Pointing at screen** | Use a pointer or hand, don't block view |
| **Energy** | 20% higher than feels natural |

**Reading the Room (In-Person):**

| Body Language | Meaning | Response |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| Leaning forward | Engaged, interested | Slow down, this matters |
| Leaning back, arms crossed | Skeptical or bored | Ask a question, change topic |
| Looking at phone | Distracted | Re-engage or take a break |
| Note-taking | High interest | Offer to send details |
| Side conversations | Confusion or politics | Pause, address directly |
| Clock watching | Ready to leave | Wrap up, get to close |

### Hybrid Demo Considerations

**When part of audience is remote:**

```
EQUAL TREATMENT
□ Look at camera regularly (not just in-room people)
□ Repeat in-room questions for remote audience
□ Use names for remote participants
□ Share screen even if room has display
□ Position camera to include room display

TECHNICAL
□ Dedicated laptop for video call
□ External microphone for room audio
□ Check remote participants can hear/see
□ Assign someone to monitor chat
```

### Engagement Techniques by Modality

**Remote-Specific Techniques:**

| Technique | How to Use |
|-----------|------------|
| **Chat prompts** | "Drop a 1 in chat if you've seen this problem" |
| **Reactions** | "Give me a thumbs up if this is clear" |
| **Breakout discussion** | "Turn off video for 2 min and discuss with your team" |
| **Share screen request** | "Would you mind showing me your current process?" |
| **Annotation** | "Let me highlight exactly where you'd click..." |

**In-Person-Specific Techniques:**

| Technique | How to Use |
|-----------|------------|
| **Whiteboard** | "Let me sketch out how this would work for you" |
| **Physical demo** | "Here's what the mobile app looks like" (pass device) |
| **Room movement** | Walk to different parts of room to engage different people |
| **Tangible leave-behind** | "Here's a one-pager you can share with your team" |
| **Business cards** | "Let me give you my direct line" |

### Remote-Specific Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge: Can't tell if they're engaged**
```
Solution: "I want to make sure I'm covering what matters
to you. On a scale of 1-5, how relevant is what you're
seeing? Drop it in the chat."
```

**Challenge: Technical difficulties on their end**
```
Solution: "It looks like there might be some connectivity
issues. Can you hear me okay? Let's try [solution]. If
it continues, I can send you a recording to supplement."
```

**Challenge: Multitasking / checking email**
```
Solution: Direct engagement — "Tom, I'd love your take
on this specific workflow. Does it match how your team
would use this?"
```

**Challenge: Time zone fatigue**
```
Solution: "I know it's [early/late] for you. Let me make
sure we cover the most important things first. What's
the one thing you absolutely need to see today?"
```

### In-Person-Specific Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge: Room technology doesn't work**
```
Solution: Have backup plan — laptop screen for small group,
screenshots printed, or reschedule if critical
```

**Challenge: Stakeholder walks in late**
```
Solution: "Great to have you, [Name]. Let me give you
a 30-second context. We're covering [topic]. I'll be
sure to circle back on anything you need."
```

**Challenge: Side conversations**
```
Solution: Pause, look at the people talking, wait for
quiet. If continues: "I want to make sure I address any
concerns. Should we pause for a moment?"
```

**Challenge: Energy in the room is low**
```
Solution: Change something — stand up, ask a question,
share a surprising stat, offer a break
```

### Recording Best Practices

**For Remote Demos:**

```
ALWAYS
□ Ask permission before recording
□ Confirm in chat who is recording
□ Know where recording will be saved
□ Have a plan for sharing recording

RECORDING USE CASES
- Share with stakeholders who couldn't attend
- Reference for follow-up questions
- Training for your team
- Internal deal review
```

**Recording Statement:**
```
"I'd like to record this for anyone who couldn't join
and so you have a reference. The recording will only
be shared with you and [AE Name] for follow-up. Is
everyone okay with that?"
```

### Anti-Patterns

**Remote:**
- Camera off (hiding undermines trust)
- Monotone delivery (must overcompensate vocally)
- Too much screen time without interaction
- Not using participant names
- Ignoring chat questions
- Sharing desktop instead of window (messy, risky)

**In-Person:**
- Sitting when you should stand
- Back to audience while presenting
- No eye contact (stuck on screen)
- Reading from notes
- Ignoring room dynamics
- Not adapting to energy levels
