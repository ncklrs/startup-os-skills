## Script Pacing and Timing

**Impact: HIGH**

Pacing determines whether viewers stay engaged or drop off. Great video scripts breathe - they know when to move fast and when to let moments land.

## Pacing Principles

### The 3-Second Rule

Viewers need time to:
1. See what's on screen (0.5s)
2. Read the text (1.5-2s)
3. Process the message (0.5-1s)

**Minimum scene duration**: 3 seconds for simple messages

### Reading Time Formula

```
Reading time (seconds) = (Word count ÷ 3) + 1

Examples:
"Try free today" (3 words) = 2s minimum
"Transform your workflow in minutes" (5 words) = 2.7s minimum
"Join 10,000 teams already shipping faster" (6 words) = 3s minimum
```

Add +1s if visual is complex or if introducing new concept.

## Scene Duration Guidelines

### Micro-Scenes (2-5s)

**Use for**:
- Simple text statements
- Quick transitions
- Logo/branding moments
- Single product screenshots

**Example**:
```
Scene: Hook (0-3s)
Copy: "Tired of manual data entry?"
Visual: Person frustrated at spreadsheet
Duration: 3s

Why this works:
- Simple question (5 words = 2.7s minimum)
- Visual reinforces (not complex)
- 3s total is adequate
```

### Short Scenes (5-10s)

**Use for**:
- Problem statements with context
- Single feature demonstrations
- Testimonial quotes
- Before/after comparisons

**Example**:
```
Scene: Problem Detail (5-13s, Duration: 8s)
Copy: "Your sales team spends 15 hours per week on admin tasks instead of selling"
Visual: Split screen showing time breakdown
Duration: 8s

Why this works:
- Longer copy (13 words = 5.3s to read)
- Visual requires processing (data breakdown)
- 8s allows message to land
```

### Medium Scenes (10-20s)

**Use for**:
- Multi-step demonstrations
- Story sequences
- Multiple benefit highlights
- Complex transformations

**Example**:
```
Scene: Three-Step Demo (20-35s, Duration: 15s)
Step 1 (5s): "Connect your tools"
Step 2 (5s): "AI analyzes your data"
Step 3 (5s): "Get insights instantly"

Why this works:
- Three distinct moments need separation
- 5s each allows read + process + transition
- Total 15s feels complete, not rushed
```

### Long Scenes (20-30s+)

**Use for**:
- Detailed product walkthroughs
- Story narratives
- Multiple testimonials in sequence
- Complex problem explanations

**Only in videos 90s+**. Shorter videos can't afford long scenes.

## Pacing Patterns

### Fast → Slow → Fast

**Pattern**: Open fast, slow down for key message, speed up to close

```
Hook (0-5s): FAST
  Quick cuts, energetic
  "Grab attention"

Build (5-20s): MEDIUM
  Moderate pace
  "Build understanding"

Peak (20-35s): SLOW
  Let key message land
  "This is important"

Close (35-45s): FAST
  Drive to action
  "Act now"
```

### Good Example (45s video)

```
Scene 1: Hook (0-3s) - FAST
  Bold question, quick visual

Scene 2: Problem (3-10s) - MEDIUM
  7s to establish pain point

Scene 3: Solution Intro (10-18s) - MEDIUM
  8s to introduce product

Scene 4: Key Benefit (18-30s) - SLOW
  12s to show transformation (most important)

Scene 5: Social Proof (30-37s) - MEDIUM
  7s for testimonial

Scene 6: CTA (37-45s) - FAST
  8s clear call to action

Rhythm: Fast hook → steady build → slow emphasis → fast close
```

### Bad Example

```
All scenes 5s each, same pace throughout

Why it fails:
- Robotic, no rhythm
- No emphasis on what matters
- Viewers tune out the monotony
```

## Information Density

### Text-to-Duration Ratio

| Scene Duration | Max Words on Screen | Max Words Spoken (VO) |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 3s | 5 words | 10 words |
| 5s | 8 words | 15 words |
| 10s | 15 words | 30 words |
| 15s | 20 words | 45 words |
| 20s+ | 25 words | 60 words |

**Principle**: Voiceover can contain more info than on-screen text (viewers can read faster than speech).

### Good Example (Appropriate Density)

```
Scene: Feature Demo (10s)

On-Screen:
"Instant sync across devices"
(5 words)

Voiceover:
"Changes you make on desktop appear instantly on mobile. No manual sync, no delays."
(14 words)

Duration: 10s

Why this works:
- On-screen: Simple, readable
- VO: Adds context without overwhelming
- Both together < 20 words for 10s scene
```

### Bad Example (Too Dense)

```
Scene: Feature Demo (8s)

On-Screen:
"Real-time synchronization across all devices and platforms with automatic conflict resolution and offline support"
(15 words)

Duration: 8s

Why it fails:
- 15 words needs ~6s just to read
- Only 2s to process
- Too much information for timeframe
```

## Breathing Room

### The Pause That Sells

After important claims, pause before moving on:

**Good Example**:
```
Scene 4: Key Claim (15-25s)
  Copy (15-20s): "10x faster than spreadsheets"
  Visual: Dramatic comparison
  [1-2s pause - no new text]
  Next element (22-25s): Social proof appears
```

**Why it works**: Pause lets claim sink in, creates emphasis

**Bad Example**:
```
Scene 4: Rushed (15-20s)
  Copy (15-17s): "10x faster"
  Copy (17-20s): "Used by 5,000 teams"
  [No pause between claims]
```

**Why it fails**: No time to process first claim before second claim

## Transition Timing

### Transition Pacing

| Transition Type | Duration | When to Use |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Fast cut** | 0s (instant) | High energy, rapid fire, montages |
| **Quick fade** | 0.3-0.5s | Standard transitions, maintains pace |
| **Medium transition** | 0.5-1s | Between major sections, scene changes |
| **Slow transition** | 1-2s | Dramatic moments, emphasis |

### Good Example

```
Hook (0-5s)
  → Quick fade (0.3s)
Problem (5-15s)
  → Medium transition (0.8s) [major section change]
Solution (15-35s)
  → Quick fade (0.3s)
Social Proof (35-42s)
  → Quick fade (0.3s)
CTA (42-50s)

Total transitions: 2.2s (4.4% of 50s video)
```

**Rule**: Transitions should be <5% of total video duration

### Bad Example

```
Every transition: 2s long
10 scenes × 2s = 20s of transitions in 60s video (33%)

Why it fails: More time transitioning than communicating
```

## Platform-Specific Pacing

### Social Feed Videos (15-30s)

**Pacing**: FAST throughout
- Hook: 2-3s max
- Each scene: 3-6s
- Minimize transitions
- No slow moments (viewers scroll fast)

```
Good: 0-3s hook, 3-12s value, 12-18s proof, 18-30s CTA
Bad: 0-8s slow brand intro, then rushed content
```

### Explainer Videos (60-90s)

**Pacing**: VARIED
- Can afford slower build
- 10-15s scenes for complex concepts
- Strategic pauses
- Build → peak → resolve rhythm

```
Good: 0-5s hook, 5-20s problem, 20-50s solution demo, 50-70s proof, 70-90s CTA
Bad: Same pace throughout, no emphasis
```

### Long-Form VSL (3-10min)

**Pacing**: SLOW with punctuation
- Story can breathe
- 20-30s scenes for depth
- Dramatic pauses before reveals
- Multiple peaks and valleys

```
Good: Story arc with varying intensity, pauses for major claims
Bad: Monotonous presentation voice, no energy shifts
```

## Rhythm and Beat

### Musical Thinking

Think of your script like a song:

**Verse** (builds energy):
- Problem description
- Steady, building pace

**Chorus** (peak energy):
- Key benefit reveal
- Memorable, emphasized

**Bridge** (shift):
- Social proof
- Different energy, validates chorus

**Outro** (resolution):
- CTA
- Clear, decisive

### Good Example (60s)

```
Verse 1 (0-15s): Problem + agitation
  Medium pace, building tension

Chorus 1 (15-25s): Solution reveal
  Emphasis, slower, let it land

Verse 2 (25-40s): How it works
  Medium pace, demonstrating

Chorus 2 (40-50s): Transformation
  Emphasis again, mirror first chorus

Outro (50-60s): CTA
  Fast, decisive
```

## Pacing Anti-Patterns

### 1. Rushed Hook

**Bad**:
```
0-1.5s: Question appears and disappears
```

Viewers can't read it before it's gone.

**Good**:
```
0-4s: Question appears, holds, begins transition
```

### 2. Dead Air

**Bad**:
```
Long pause with nothing happening (3s+ of static screen)
```

**Good**:
```
Pauses include subtle animation, keeps visual interest
```

### 3. Uniform Scenes

**Bad**:
```
All scenes exactly 5s, perfectly uniform
```

Feels robotic, no emphasis.

**Good**:
```
Varied: 3s, 7s, 5s, 10s, 4s, 8s
```

Creates rhythm, emphasizes what matters.

### 4. Too Many Transitions

**Bad**:
```
Scene (2s) → Transition (1s) → Scene (2s) → Transition (1s)
```

50% transitions.

**Good**:
```
Scene (5s) → Quick transition (0.3s) → Scene (7s) → Quick transition (0.3s)
```

5% transitions.

## Pacing Checklist

Before finalizing timing:

**Reading Time**:
- [ ] All text has minimum 3s on screen
- [ ] Complex ideas have +1-2s extra
- [ ] Reading time calculated (words ÷ 3 + 1)

**Rhythm**:
- [ ] Varied scene lengths (not all identical)
- [ ] Fast → Medium → Slow → Fast pattern (or similar)
- [ ] Key messages have breathing room
- [ ] No scene <2s (too fast to register)

**Transitions**:
- [ ] Transitions <5% of total duration
- [ ] Transition speed matches energy
- [ ] Major section changes have longer transitions

**Emphasis**:
- [ ] Most important scene is slowest/longest
- [ ] CTA has adequate time (min 5s)
- [ ] No dead air (always visual interest)

**Platform**:
- [ ] Pace matches platform (social=fast, long-form=varied)
- [ ] Silent viewing considered (text duration)
- [ ] Attention span respected (hook fast enough)

**Information Density**:
- [ ] Text-to-duration ratio appropriate
- [ ] On-screen text < 25 words per scene
- [ ] Voiceover (if used) < 60 words per scene
- [ ] Complex visuals have extra processing time
