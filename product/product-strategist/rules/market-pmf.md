## Product-Market Fit Assessment

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Product-market fit is when the market pulls the product from you. Before PMF, nothing else matters. After PMF, everything accelerates.

### The PMF Spectrum

```
Level 0: Problem Fit
"We've found a problem worth solving"
Signals: User research confirms pain, willingness to pay indicated

Level 1: Solution Fit
"Our solution addresses the problem"
Signals: Users complete core workflow, positive feedback

Level 2: Product-Market Fit
"Customers are pulling the product from us"
Signals: Organic growth, retention, word of mouth

Level 3: Scale Fit
"We have a repeatable growth engine"
Signals: Unit economics work, channels are predictable

Level 4: Moat Fit
"We have defensible competitive advantage"
Signals: High switching costs, network effects, brand
```

### PMF Measurement Framework

**The Sean Ellis Test:**
*"How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"*

| Response | Percentage | PMF Signal |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Very disappointed | 40%+ | Strong PMF |
| Somewhat disappointed | 30-40% | Getting there |
| Not disappointed | <30% | No PMF yet |

### Quantitative PMF Indicators

| Metric | Pre-PMF | PMF Threshold | Strong PMF |
|--------|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Monthly Retention** | <30% | 40%+ | 60%+ |
| **NPS** | <20 | 30+ | 50+ |
| **Organic Signups** | <20% | 40%+ | 60%+ |
| **Payback Period** | >24 mo | <18 mo | <12 mo |
| **Week 1 Retention** | <20% | 30%+ | 50%+ |

### Qualitative PMF Signals

**You have PMF when:**
```
□ Users complain when the product is down
□ Users recommend without being asked
□ Users hack the product to do more than intended
□ Users ask for features, not refunds
□ You can't keep up with demand
□ Competitors start copying you
□ Users integrate you into their daily workflow
□ Churn rate declining each cohort
```

**You don't have PMF when:**
```
□ Growth only from sales/marketing push
□ High churn across all cohorts
□ Users say "nice" but don't return
□ Engagement drops after first week
□ You're explaining why users should care
□ Need constant discounts to retain
□ Users request things that aren't core to vision
```

### The PMF Canvas

| Dimension | Question | Signal |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Problem** | Does the problem cause significant pain? | Budget exists, active searching |
| **Segment** | Is there a well-defined who? | Can describe ideal customer precisely |
| **Value Prop** | Does your solution uniquely solve it? | Clear differentiation articulated |
| **Timing** | Why now for this solution? | Market or technology shift enabling |
| **Retention** | Do users keep coming back? | Cohort retention curves flatten |
| **Referral** | Do users tell others? | Organic/referral growth present |

### PMF By Company Stage

**Pre-Seed to Seed:**
Focus on Problem Fit and Solution Fit
```
Key activities:
- 50+ customer interviews
- 10+ users in pilot
- Qualitative validation
```

**Seed to Series A:**
Focus on achieving initial PMF
```
Key metrics:
- 100+ paying customers
- 40%+ "very disappointed" score
- Improving retention curves
```

**Series A to B:**
Focus on PMF scale and repeatability
```
Key metrics:
- Predictable acquisition channels
- Consistent cohort metrics
- Unit economics positive
```

### The Superhuman PMF Engine

```
Step 1: Survey users
        "How disappointed would you be?"

Step 2: Segment responses
        Focus on "very disappointed" segment

Step 3: Analyze why
        What do very disappointed users love?
        What do somewhat disappointed users want?

Step 4: Build for very disappointed
        Double down on what's working

Step 5: Repeat weekly
        Track % very disappointed over time
```

### Common PMF Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Better Approach |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Too broad ICP** | Can't satisfy everyone | Narrow to beachhead segment |
| **Feature bloat** | Adding features ≠ adding value | Double down on core value |
| **Premature scaling** | Scaling before retention | Fix retention first |
| **Survey bias** | Only asking happy users | Survey recent churned users |
| **Vanity metrics** | Signups, not engagement | Focus on retention |

### Fake PMF Warning Signs

**Revenue from a few large customers:**
- 1-2 customers = 80% revenue
- Custom development for each
- Not replicable

**Paid-only growth:**
- CAC increasing over time
- No organic word of mouth
- Turn off ads, growth stops

**Founder-led sales only:**
- Only founders can close deals
- Can't hire salespeople to replicate
- Process isn't documented

### PMF Recovery Playbook

**If you've lost PMF or never had it:**

```
Week 1-2:  Talk to 20 churned customers
           → Why did they leave?

Week 3-4:  Talk to 20 power users
           → Why do they stay?

Week 5-6:  Find the delta
           → What's different about retained users?

Week 7-8:  Narrow ICP
           → Who are your power users?

Week 9+:   Rebuild for narrow segment
           → 100 users who love > 1,000 who like
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Declaring PMF too early** — One viral moment isn't PMF
- **Moving past PMF** — Scaling features before nailing core
- **Surveying wrong users** — Surveying prospects, not users
- **Ignoring churn reasons** — Focusing on acquisition, not retention
- **Changing too many variables** — Can't learn if changing everything
- **Building for churned users** — They already decided you're not for them
