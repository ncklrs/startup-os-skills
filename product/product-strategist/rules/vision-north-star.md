## Product Vision and North Star Metrics

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Vision is your destination. North star metrics tell you if you're on course. Without both, you're navigating without a compass.

### The Vision Stack

```
PURPOSE         →  "Why do we exist?"
                    (Company level, rarely changes)

VISION          →  "What does the future look like?"
                    (3-10 years, inspiring, specific)

MISSION         →  "How do we achieve the vision?"
                    (Operational, actionable)

STRATEGY        →  "What trade-offs do we make?"
                    (1-3 years, focused)
```

### Crafting Product Vision

**Great vision characteristics:**
- **Specific enough** to guide decisions
- **Inspiring enough** to motivate teams
- **Ambitious enough** to attract talent
- **Believable enough** to seem achievable

### Vision Formula

**For [target customers], [product name] will be the [category] that [key transformation], creating a world where [better future state].**

### Good vs Bad Vision Examples

| Company | Bad Vision | Good Vision |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Notion** | "Be a productivity tool company" | "Make toolmaking ubiquitous — everyone should be able to build their own tools" |
| **Stripe** | "Process payments well" | "Increase the GDP of the internet by making it easy for anyone to start a business" |
| **Figma** | "Make a design tool" | "Make design accessible to everyone — where teams design together" |
| **Linear** | "Build a better issue tracker" | "Build software faster — create the system of record for how software gets built" |

### North Star Metric Framework

Your north star should:
1. **Reflect value delivered** — Measures customer success, not business success
2. **Lead to revenue** — Eventually, if customers get value, you make money
3. **Be actionable** — Teams can influence it
4. **Be measurable** — Can track progress weekly/monthly

### North Star by Business Type

| Business Type | North Star Example | Why |
|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| **SaaS** | Weekly active users, or tasks completed | Value delivery frequency |
| **Marketplace** | Gross merchandise value | Transaction volume |
| **Media** | Time spent, engagement | Attention captured |
| **Fintech** | Transactions processed, money moved | Core value action |
| **Developer Tools** | Deployments, API calls | Usage depth |

### Example: Slack's Metric Evolution

```
Early Stage:     Messages sent per user
                 (Measures adoption)

Growth Stage:    Daily active users
                 (Measures habit)

Scale Stage:     Messages sent in channels with 3+ active users
                 (Measures collaboration value)
```

### Input vs Output Metrics

```
                    NORTH STAR (Output)
                          │
            ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
            │             │             │
            ▼             ▼             ▼
     ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
     │  Input   │  │  Input   │  │  Input   │
     │ Metric 1 │  │ Metric 2 │  │ Metric 3 │
     │ Signups  │  │ Activatn │  │ Features │
     │          │  │ Rate     │  │ Adopted  │
     └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘
```

### Vision-to-Metrics Alignment

| Vision Element | Metric Category | Example Metric |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Target customer | Acquisition | Signups from ICP |
| Core value | Activation | Time to first value |
| Transformation | Engagement | Feature adoption rate |
| Better future | Retention | Monthly retention rate |

### Testing Your North Star

**The "So What" Test:**
- If this metric doubles, does the business meaningfully improve?
- If this metric halves, are we in trouble?
- Can every team contribute to moving this?

**The "Gaming" Test:**
- Can this be artificially inflated without real value?
- Does optimizing for this create perverse incentives?

### Anti-Patterns

**Vision Anti-Patterns:**
- **Too vague** — "Build great products" (means nothing)
- **Too narrow** — "Be the #1 CRM" (ceiling, not destination)
- **Competitor-defined** — "Beat Salesforce" (not inspiring)
- **Technology-first** — "Be the AI company" (how, not why)

**North Star Anti-Patterns:**
- **Revenue as north star** — Lags value delivery, not actionable
- **Vanity metrics** — Signups without activation, followers without engagement
- **Too many metrics** — If everything is a north star, nothing is
- **Unchanging metrics** — North star should evolve with company stage

### Implementation Checklist

```
□ Vision can be explained in one sentence
□ Vision answers "what does success look like in 5 years?"
□ Team can recite the vision
□ North star metric identified
□ Input metrics mapped to north star
□ Every team has line of sight to north star
□ Weekly review of north star progress
□ Quarterly review of metric validity
```
