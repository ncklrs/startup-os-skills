## Monetization Strategy

**Impact: HIGH**

Monetization is where product value becomes business value. The best monetization strategies align with how customers perceive and receive value.

### Pricing Strategies

**1. Value-Based Pricing**
Price based on value delivered to customer.

```
Best for: Products with measurable ROI
Example:  Security product saves $500K/year in breach costs
          → Price at $50K/year (10% of value)
```

**2. Competitor-Based Pricing**
Price relative to alternatives.

```
Best for: Entering established markets
Example:  Competitors charge $100/seat
          → Price at $80/seat (value position) or
          → Price at $150/seat (premium position)
```

**3. Cost-Plus Pricing**
Price based on costs plus margin.

```
Best for: Commoditized products, low differentiation
Example:  Cost $10 to serve, price at $15 (50% margin)
Warning:  Ignores value, often leaves money on table
```

### Pricing Metric Selection

**Choose a metric that:**
- Scales with customer value
- Is easy to understand
- Customers can predict their bill
- Grows as customers grow

| Metric | Best For | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Per seat** | Collaboration tools | Slack, Figma |
| **Per use** | APIs, transactions | Stripe, Twilio |
| **Per resource** | Infrastructure | AWS EC2, Snowflake |
| **Flat rate** | Simple products | Netflix, Basecamp |
| **Per outcome** | Performance marketing | Affiliate networks |

### Price Localization

**Adjust pricing by market:**

| Region | Relative Pricing | Rationale |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| USA | 100% (baseline) | Highest willingness to pay |
| Western Europe | 90-100% | Similar purchasing power |
| Eastern Europe | 50-70% | Lower GDP per capita |
| LATAM | 40-60% | Emerging market |
| India | 20-40% | Price sensitivity, volume potential |

### Expansion Revenue Strategies

**Net Revenue Retention > 100% through:**

| Strategy | How It Works | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Seat expansion** | Team grows, adds seats | Company grows from 10 → 50 users |
| **Usage growth** | Consumption increases | API calls grow 5x |
| **Upsell** | Upgrade to higher tier | Pro → Enterprise |
| **Cross-sell** | Buy additional products | Add new module |
| **Price increase** | Annual price bumps | 3-5% annual increase |

### Monetization Timing Framework

| Stage | Focus | Actions |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Pre-PMF** | Learn, don't optimize | Free/cheap, gather feedback |
| **Early PMF** | Validate willingness to pay | Simple pricing, manual billing OK |
| **Growth** | Optimize and scale | Tier pricing, self-serve billing |
| **Scale** | Maximize revenue | Usage-based, enterprise sales |

### Pricing Page Best Practices

**Good Pricing Page:**
```
✓ 3-4 tiers maximum
✓ Most popular tier highlighted
✓ Clear feature comparison
✓ Annual discount visible
✓ Enterprise "contact us" option
✓ Free trial or money-back guarantee
✓ Social proof (logos, testimonials)
```

**Example Tier Structure:**

| | Free | Pro | Business | Enterprise |
|------|------|-----|----------|------------|
| **Price** | $0 | $29/mo | $99/mo | Custom |
| **Users** | 1 | 5 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Features** | Basic | Full | Full + API | Full + SSO |
| **Support** | Community | Email | Priority | Dedicated |
| **Best For** | Individuals | Small teams | Growing teams | Large orgs |

### Pricing Experiments

**Test pricing safely:**

| Method | How | Risk Level |
|--------|-----|------------|
| **New segments** | Test on new cohort | Low |
| **Geographic** | Different prices by region | Low |
| **Grandfather** | New pricing for new customers | Medium |
| **A/B test** | Random assignment | Medium |
| **Price increase** | Announce, then raise | High |

### Discounting Strategy

**When to discount:**
- Annual vs monthly (10-20% discount)
- Startup/nonprofit tiers
- Strategic accounts
- Competitive win-backs

**When NOT to discount:**
- To close every deal (trains buyers)
- Below profitable unit economics
- Without getting something in return

**Healthy discount framework:**
```
First negotiation:    10% for annual
Second ask:           Logo rights / case study
Third ask:            Longer contract term
Hard line:            No further discount
```

### Revenue Diversification

**Multiple revenue streams reduce risk:**

| Primary | Secondary | Tertiary |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Subscription | Usage fees | Services |
| License | Support | Training |
| Platform | Marketplace cut | Data/API |

### Pricing Communication

**Raising prices? Communicate well:**

```
1. Give advance notice (60-90 days)
2. Explain the why (value added)
3. Grandfather existing contracts
4. Offer annual lock-in at old price
5. Highlight new features/value
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Race to bottom** — Competing only on price
- **Complex pricing** — 10+ tiers, confusing metrics
- **Hidden fees** — Surprise charges at billing time
- **No free trial** — Barrier to trying product
- **Discounting to everyone** — Trains customers to negotiate
- **Annual-only** — Friction for new customers
- **Never raising prices** — Leaving money on table
- **Charging for wrong thing** — Pricing metric misaligned with value
- **Same price forever** — Ignoring market changes
