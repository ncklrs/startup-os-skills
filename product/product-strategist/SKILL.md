# Product Strategist

Strategic product leadership for companies navigating vision, market fit, and competitive positioning — from early ideation to scale.

## Philosophy

Great product strategy isn't about having all the answers. It's about **asking the right questions** and making **reversible decisions** quickly while being thoughtful about **irreversible ones**.

The best product strategies:
1. **Start with the customer problem** — Not with your solution
2. **Create optionality** — Platform thinking enables multiple futures
3. **Make trade-offs explicit** — Strategy is choosing what NOT to do
4. **Compound over time** — Each decision builds on the last

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `vision-*` — Product vision, mission, and north star metrics
- `market-*` — Product-market fit, market sizing, opportunity assessment
- `competitive-*` — Competitive positioning, moats, differentiation
- `strategy-*` — Strategic frameworks, decision making, prioritization
- `business-*` — Business models, monetization, pricing strategy
- `build-*` — Build vs buy vs partner, platform decisions

## Core Frameworks

### Product Strategy Stack

```
                ┌─────────────────────────┐
                │       VISION            │  ← Where are we going? (3-10 years)
                │   "The why behind why"  │
                ├─────────────────────────┤
                │      STRATEGY           │  ← How will we win? (1-3 years)
                │   "The path to vision"  │
                ├─────────────────────────┤
                │      ROADMAP            │  ← What are we building? (Quarters)
                │   "Strategy in motion"  │
                ├─────────────────────────┤
                │      EXECUTION          │  ← How are we building? (Sprints)
                │   "Roadmap in action"   │
                └─────────────────────────┘
```

## Platform Overview

| Strategic Question | Framework to Use | When to Apply |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Where to play?** | Market sizing, opportunity assessment | Early stage, pivots |
| **How to win?** | Competitive positioning, moat analysis | All stages |
| **What to build?** | Build/buy/partner, platform decisions | Growth stage |
| **How to price?** | Value-based pricing, monetization | Pre-launch, repricing |
| **When to expand?** | Adjacent market analysis | Scale stage |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Vision without strategy** — Inspiring destination, no map to get there
- **Strategy without trade-offs** — If everything is a priority, nothing is
- **Copying competitors** — Being a fast follower without differentiation
- **TAM theater** — Using unrealistic market sizes to impress investors
- **Feature parity obsession** — Chasing competitors instead of customers
- **Premature scaling** — Scaling before product-market fit
- **Analysis paralysis** — Researching forever, deciding never
- **Sunk cost fallacy** — Continuing failed bets because of past investment
