## 1. Launch Planning (planning)
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Foundational launch decisions — tiering, timelines, success criteria, and strategic alignment. The blueprint for everything that follows.

## 2. Cross-Functional Coordination (coordination)
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Stakeholder alignment, RACI matrices, and orchestrating multiple teams toward a unified launch. Where most launches fail.

## 3. Beta & Early Access (beta)
**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Pre-launch validation programs, beta cohort management, and feedback integration. De-risk before you launch.

## 4. Launch Communications (communication)
**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Internal enablement, external messaging, and multi-channel communication plans. What you say and when you say it.

## 5. Launch Execution (execution)
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Launch day operations, war rooms, runbooks, and real-time decision making. The moment of truth.

## 6. Post-Launch Operations (postlaunch)
**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Monitoring, retrospectives, metrics analysis, and iterative improvement. The launch isn't over when it ships.
