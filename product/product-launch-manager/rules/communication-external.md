## External Launch Communications

**Impact: HIGH**

Your launch message reaches customers once. Make it count with clear, compelling communication across all channels.

### Messaging Framework

**The 3-Part Launch Message:**

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **What** | Feature description | "Enterprise SSO with SAML and SCIM" |
| **So What** | Benefit | "Secure your team with one-click login" |
| **Now What** | CTA | "Enable SSO in Admin Settings today" |

### Good Example: Launch Blog Post

```markdown
# Introducing Enterprise SSO: Secure Your Team with One-Click Login

Your security team has been asking. Your IT team has been waiting.
Today, we're launching Enterprise SSO - making [Product] as secure
as it is powerful.

## What's New

Enterprise SSO brings:
- **SAML 2.0 & OIDC support** - Works with Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin,
  and any standards-compliant identity provider
- **SCIM provisioning** - Automatically sync users from your IdP
- **Just-in-time provisioning** - New users created on first login

## Why It Matters

[Quote from Security Leader at beta customer]

**For IT teams:** No more manual user management. When someone leaves,
they're automatically deprovisioned. No forgotten accounts, no security gaps.

**For employees:** One click to log in. No more password to remember.
No more "forgot password" flows.

**For security teams:** Audit every login. Enforce MFA through your IdP.
Meet compliance requirements for SOC 2, HIPAA, and more.

## How to Get Started

1. Navigate to Admin > Security > SSO
2. Select your identity provider
3. Follow our step-by-step guide (average setup: 15 minutes)

[CTA Button: Enable SSO Now]

## Pricing

Enterprise SSO is included in our Enterprise plan at no additional cost.
Business plan customers can add SSO for $X/user/month.

### Bad Example: Weak Launch Communication

```markdown
# New Feature: SSO

We added SSO to our product. You can now use SSO to log in.

SSO stands for Single Sign-On. It lets you log in with your
company credentials.

To use it, go to settings and turn it on.

Thanks,
The Team

**Why This Fails:**
- No value proposition
- No differentiation
- No specific capabilities mentioned
- No social proof
- Weak CTA
- Forgettable
```

### Email Campaign Structure

| How-to | T+2 days | Drive adoption | "Get started with SSO in 15 minutes" |
| Social proof | T+1 week | Reinforce value | "How [Customer] secured their team" |

- **Feature-first** — Leading with what, not why
- **No CTA** — Announcement without action
- **One channel** — Blog only, no distribution
- **Bad timing** — Friday afternoon or holiday launch
- **No visuals** — Text-only announcements
- **Inconsistent message** — Different story on each channel
- **Premature PR** — Press release for Tier 3 feature
