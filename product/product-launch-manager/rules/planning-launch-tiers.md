## Launch Tiering Strategy

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Not every launch deserves a keynote. Tiering ensures you invest the right resources for the right impact.

### The Four Launch Tiers

| Tier | Investment | Timeline | Team Involvement | Typical Outputs |
|------|------------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Tier 1: Flagship** | Maximum | 8-12 weeks | All functions, exec sponsors | Event, press, full campaign |
| **Tier 2: Major** | High | 4-8 weeks | Product, Marketing, Sales, Support | Blog, email, PR, enablement |
| **Tier 3: Standard** | Medium | 2-4 weeks | Product, Marketing | Blog, changelog, targeted email |
| **Tier 4: Maintenance** | Minimal | 1-2 weeks | Product, Engineering | Changelog, in-app notification |

### Tier Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to determine the appropriate tier:

| Factor | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Revenue Impact** | >$1M ARR | $100K-$1M | $10K-$100K | <$10K |
| **User Impact** | All users | Major segment | Specific cohort | Power users |
| **Competitive** | Market defining | Market leading | Parity | Hygiene |
| **Strategic** | New market/product | Expansion | Enhancement | Fix/polish |
| **Risk Level** | High visibility | Moderate | Low | Minimal |

### Tier 1: Flagship Launch Checklist

```
□ Executive sponsor assigned
□ Cross-functional launch team formed
□ 12-week timeline established
□ Press/analyst strategy defined
□ Event or major moment identified
□ Full marketing campaign planned
□ Sales enablement program designed
□ Customer advisory board briefed
□ Success metrics with exec alignment
□ Post-launch monitoring plan
```

### Tier 2: Major Launch Checklist

```
□ Product marketing owner assigned
□ 6-week timeline established
□ Blog post and supporting content
□ Email campaign to relevant segments
□ Social media campaign
□ Sales one-pager and talking points
□ Support documentation updated
□ In-app announcement planned
□ Success metrics defined
```

### Good Example: Proper Tiering

```markdown
## Launch Brief: Enterprise SSO

**Proposed Tier: 2 (Major)**

**Justification:**
- Revenue: Enables $500K pipeline in enterprise segment
- User Impact: Top requested feature from enterprise prospects
- Competitive: Achieves parity with market leaders
- Strategic: Key to enterprise expansion strategy

**Approved Resources:**
- 6-week timeline
- Dedicated PMM owner
- Blog + email + social campaign
- Sales enablement session
- Updated security whitepaper
- Support team training
```

### Bad Example: Over-Tiered Launch

```markdown
## Launch Brief: Dashboard Dark Mode

**Proposed Tier: 1 (Flagship)**  ← WRONG

**Justification:**
- "Users have been asking for this for years"
- "It looks really cool"
- "We should do a big splash"

**Why This Fails:**
- Dark mode is a Tier 3 or 4 feature
- Minimal revenue impact
- No competitive differentiation
- Wastes resources, burns out team
- Dilutes impact of actual Tier 1 launches
```

### Good Example: Under-Tiered Recognition

```markdown
## Launch Review: API v2.0

**Initial Tier: 3 (Standard)**
**Revised Tier: 2 (Major)**

**Why Upgrade:**
- Discovered 40% of enterprise pipeline blocked on API limitations
- Competitive analysis shows this is differentiating capability
- Developer community engagement opportunity
- Platform ecosystem enablement

**Added Resources:**
- Developer-focused blog series
- API documentation revamp
- Developer community event
- Integration partner outreach
```

### Tiering Escalation Triggers

**Upgrade tier when:**
- Executive visibility increases
- Competitive landscape shifts
- Customer demand exceeds expectations
- Strategic priority changes
- Partner/press interest emerges

**Downgrade tier when:**
- Scope reduces significantly
- Timeline compresses
- Resources become constrained
- Market window passes
- Feature becomes table stakes

### Anti-Patterns

- **Everything is Tier 1** — Launch fatigue destroys impact and burns teams
- **No tiering system** — Every launch reinvents the wheel
- **Tier by politics** — Exec pet projects get over-resourced
- **Static tiers** — Refusing to adjust as circumstances change
- **Tier without criteria** — Gut feel instead of structured decision
- **Tiering too late** — Deciding resources after work begins
