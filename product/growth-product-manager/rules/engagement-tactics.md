## Engagement Tactics & Habit Formation

**Impact: HIGH**

Engagement is the bridge between activation and retention. Users who engage deeply form habits, and habits drive long-term retention and monetization.

### The Engagement Equation

```
Engagement = Frequency × Depth × Breadth

Frequency: How often users return
Depth:     How much time/actions per session
Breadth:   How many features they use
```

### Engagement Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **DAU/MAU** | Daily active / Monthly active | Stickiness ratio |
| **Sessions/User** | Average sessions per user | Return frequency |
| **Session Duration** | Time per session | Depth of engagement |
| **Actions/Session** | Core actions per session | Usage intensity |
| **Feature Adoption** | % using key features | Breadth of usage |
| **L7/L30** | Days active in last 30 | Habit strength |

### DAU/MAU Benchmarks

```
DAU/MAU Ratio (Stickiness):

50%+   : Daily habit product (messaging, productivity)
         Example: Slack, WhatsApp

25-50% : Frequent use product (work tools)
         Example: Figma, Linear

10-25% : Weekly use product (planning, reporting)
         Example: Analytics tools, project management

<10%   : Occasional use (utilities, specific workflows)
         Example: Tax software, travel booking
```

### Building Habits: The Hook Model

### Trigger Design

**External Triggers (You Control):**

| Trigger Type | Example | Best For |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Email** | "Sarah commented on your doc" | Async updates |
| **Push** | "Your report is ready" | Time-sensitive |
| **SMS** | "Verification code: 123456" | Critical actions |
| **In-app** | "Try our new feature" | Active users |
| **Badge** | Notification count | Curiosity |

**Internal Triggers (User Creates):**

| Trigger | Emotion | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Boredom** | "I'm bored" | Open Twitter, TikTok |
| **Uncertainty** | "I wonder..." | Open Slack, email |
| **Loneliness** | "I need connection" | Open messaging app |
| **Anxiety** | "Did I miss something?" | Check notifications |
| **Accomplishment** | "I want to make progress" | Open productivity app |

**Goal: Associate your product with an internal trigger.**

### Variable Reward Types

```
TRIBE (Social Rewards):
- Likes, comments, followers
- Recognition from peers
- Social validation
Example: LinkedIn endorsements

HUNT (Information Rewards):
- New content to discover
- Answers to questions
- Relevant information
Example: Twitter feed

SELF (Achievement Rewards):
- Mastery, completion
- Progress tracking
- Personal growth
Example: Duolingo streaks
```

### Investment Mechanisms

**User investment increases switching costs:**

| Investment Type | Example | Effect |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| **Data** | Notes, documents | Can't leave data behind |
| **Followers** | Social graphs | Network locked in |
| **Reputation** | Reviews, karma | Status non-portable |
| **Personalization** | Settings, preferences | Tailored experience |
| **Skill** | Keyboard shortcuts | Expertise in tool |
| **Content** | Created assets | Portfolio in platform |

### Engagement Tactics by Stage

**New Users (Week 1):**

```
Goal: Build initial engagement pattern

Tactics:
□ Welcome sequence with daily tips
□ Quick wins to celebrate
□ Checklist progress gamification
□ Personal "aha moment" push
□ Low-friction daily trigger
```

**Developing Users (Week 2-4):**

```
Goal: Establish regular usage pattern

Tactics:
□ Feature discovery prompts
□ Usage streaks/achievements
□ Social features introduction
□ Integration suggestions
□ "Power user" tips
```

**Established Users (Month 2+):**

```
Goal: Deepen engagement and prevent decay

Tactics:
□ Advanced feature unlocks
□ Community involvement
□ Referral program
□ Exclusive content/features
□ Recognition/status
```

### Gamification Elements

**Use Sparingly But Effectively:**

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Progress bars** | Show completion | Profile 80% complete |
| **Streaks** | Encourage consistency | 7-day streak |
| **Points** | Quantify activity | 1,000 XP earned |
| **Levels** | Show advancement | Level 5 User |
| **Badges** | Recognize achievement | "Power User" badge |
| **Leaderboards** | Social competition | Top 10 contributors |

**Gamification Anti-Patterns:**

```
Bad Gamification:
✗ Points that mean nothing
✗ Badges for trivial actions
✗ Forced social competition
✗ Rewards unrelated to value
✗ Gamification that feels manipulative

Good Gamification:
✓ Celebrates real accomplishments
✓ Guides users to value
✓ Creates positive habits
✓ Feels natural to product
```

### Notification Strategy

**The Notification Hierarchy:**

```
Priority 1: User-to-user (highest engagement)
            "Sarah mentioned you"

Priority 2: User-triggered events
            "Your export is ready"

Priority 3: Personalized insights
            "Your weekly summary"

Priority 4: Feature education
            "Have you tried X?"

Priority 5: Marketing (lowest engagement)
            "Check out our new feature"
```

**Notification Timing:**

| Timing | Best For | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Real-time** | Urgent, social | Mentions, messages |
| **Batched** | Non-urgent, volume | Daily digest |
| **Smart** | Personalized timing | When user usually active |
| **Triggered** | Specific conditions | Abandoned cart, inactivity |

### Re-Engagement Campaigns

**Churn Risk → Intervention:**

```
Signal: No login in 3 days
→ Push: "You have 5 unread messages"

Signal: Decreased usage (50% drop)
→ Email: "We noticed you haven't used X"

Signal: Stopped using key feature
→ In-app: "Need help with [feature]?"

Signal: Approaching renewal
→ Email: "Here's what you accomplished"
```

**Win-Back Sequence:**

```
Day 3:   "We miss you" + value reminder
Day 7:   "Here's what's new" + updates
Day 14:  "Your data is waiting" + FOMO
Day 30:  "Special offer to return" + incentive
Day 60:  "Last chance" + data deletion warning
```

### Measuring Engagement Health

### Anti-Patterns

- **Notification spam** — More notifications ≠ more engagement
- **Dark patterns** — Tricks that hurt trust (fake urgency, hidden unsubscribe)
- **Engagement at any cost** — Metrics up, but users unhappy
- **Ignoring user preferences** — One-size-fits-all communication
- **Gamification overload** — Points and badges everywhere
- **No value, only dopamine** — Engagement without outcome
- **Measuring vanity metrics** — Sessions without actions
- **Abandoning churned users** — They can come back
