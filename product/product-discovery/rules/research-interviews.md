## User Interview Techniques

**Impact: CRITICAL**

User interviews are the cornerstone of discovery. Great interviews uncover truth; bad interviews confirm bias.

### The Interview Spectrum

| Type | Goal | Duration | Sample Size |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Discovery** | Explore problem space | 45-60 min | 8-12 |
| **Problem validation** | Confirm specific pain | 30-45 min | 6-10 |
| **Solution testing** | Evaluate concepts | 30-45 min | 5-8 |
| **Usability** | Test interface | 30-60 min | 5-8 |
| **JTBD** | Understand motivation | 45-60 min | 8-15 |

### The Mom Test

Every question should pass "The Mom Test" — could someone lie to you to be nice?

**Bad Questions (Your Mom Would Lie)**
```
"Would you use an app that does X?"
"Do you think this is a good idea?"
"How much would you pay for this?"
"Would this solve your problem?"
```

**Good Questions (Mom Can't Lie)**
```
"Tell me about the last time you had this problem."
"Walk me through how you currently handle this."
"What have you tried to solve this? What happened?"
"How much time/money do you spend on this today?"
```

### Question Frameworks

**Start Wide, Go Deep**
```
Level 1: "Tell me about your role..."
Level 2: "What are your biggest challenges in [area]?"
Level 3: "You mentioned X — tell me more about that."
Level 4: "When did this last happen? Walk me through it."
Level 5: "What did you do next? How did that work out?"
```

**The Five Whys**
```
"I'm frustrated with our reporting."
  → Why? "It takes too long to create reports."
  → Why? "I have to pull data from three different systems."
  → Why? "Our tools don't integrate."
  → Why? "We bought them at different times for different teams."
  → Why? "No one thought about the big picture."

Root cause: Lack of integrated planning, not the reporting tool itself.
```

**Timeline Reconstruction**
```
"Take me back to when you first realized this was a problem..."
"What happened next?"
"Then what did you do?"
"Who else was involved?"
"How did you feel at that point?"
"What ultimately happened?"
```

### Interview Structure

**Opening (5 min)**
```
1. Thank them, set expectations
2. Get permission to record
3. Explain confidentiality
4. Start with easy warmup questions
```

**Core Interview (25-45 min)**
```
5. Current state exploration
6. Problem deep-dives (use 5 whys)
7. Past behavior (not future promises)
8. Specific examples and stories
```

**Closing (5-10 min)**
```
9. Summary and reflection
10. Ask who else to talk to
11. Thank and explain next steps
```

### Good vs Bad Interview Practices

**Good Practices**
```
- Ask about specific past behavior
  "Tell me about the last time..."

- Let them talk (aim for 80% them, 20% you)
  "Mm-hmm. And then?"

- Follow the energy
  "You seemed frustrated when you mentioned X. Tell me more."

- Get concrete
  "Can you show me how you do that?"

- Embrace silence (count to 5 before jumping in)
  [Wait]

- Ask about money already spent
  "What have you tried? How much did that cost?"
```

**Bad Practices**
```
- Ask about future behavior (unreliable)
  "Would you use..." "Do you think..."

- Lead the witness
  "Don't you find X frustrating?"

- Pitch during interview
  "What if I told you our product does..."

- Multiple questions at once
  "How do you do X and does Y ever happen?"

- Accept vague answers
  "It's hard." → "Hard how? Give me an example."

- Interrupt or fill silences
  [They're still thinking!]
```

### Capturing Insights

**During Interview**
```
- Record with permission (and always take notes as backup)
- Note emotional reactions (frustration, excitement)
- Capture exact quotes
- Mark surprising statements with "!!"
```

**Note-Taking Template**
```
Participant: [ID, not name]
Date:
Context: [Role, company type, etc.]

Key Quotes:
- "[Exact quote]" — about [topic]

Behaviors Observed:
- Currently does X
- Tried Y, didn't work because...

Pain Points:
- Problem: [Description]
  Frequency: [How often]
  Severity: [1-10]
  Current solution: [What they do now]

Surprises:
- Didn't expect: [Observation]

Follow-up Questions:
- Need to explore: [Question]
```

### Sample Size Guidelines

| Research Goal | Minimum | Ideal | When to Stop |
|--------------|---------|-------|--------------|
| Exploratory discovery | 5 | 8-12 | New themes stop emerging |
| Problem validation | 5 | 6-10 | 80% confirm the problem |
| Segment comparison | 5 per segment | 8 per segment | Clear differences emerge |
| JTBD mapping | 10 | 12-20 | Jobs and contexts repeat |

**Signs You've Done Enough**
- Same themes recurring
- No new problems emerging
- You can predict what they'll say
- Team aligned on insights

### Anti-Patterns

- **Confirmation bias** — Only hearing what supports your hypothesis
- **Friendly user trap** — Only talking to people who like you
- **Leading questions** — "Don't you hate when X happens?"
- **Solution pushing** — Pitching instead of listening
- **Proxy interviews** — Asking sales/support instead of users
- **Premature synthesis** — Concluding after 2-3 interviews
- **Note-taking neglect** — Trusting memory over documentation
