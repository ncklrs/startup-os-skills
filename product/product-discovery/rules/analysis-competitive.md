## Competitive Analysis

**Impact: HIGH**

Know your competition deeply — not to copy them, but to differentiate from them. The goal is finding gaps, not matching features.

### Competition Landscape

**Types of Competitors**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Direct** | Same solution, same market | Figma vs Sketch |
| **Indirect** | Different solution, same job | Notion vs Confluence vs Google Docs |
| **Alternative** | Different approach entirely | Hiring an agency vs using a tool |
| **Inertia** | Doing nothing | Status quo, manual processes |

**Map Your Competitive Landscape**

                        │
                        │

                    STARTUP/SMB
```

**Positioning Questions:**
- What axes matter most to customers?
- Where are competitors clustered?
- Where is whitespace?
- Can you own a unique position?

### Win/Loss Analysis

**Track Why You Win and Lose**

| Beta Inc | Lost | Missing feature X | | Comp B |
| Gamma LLC | Lost | Existing relationship | | Comp A |
| Delta Co | Won | Integration with Y | Support | Comp C |

**Patterns to Look For:**
- Which competitor do you win against most?
- Which features matter in won deals?
- Why do you lose? Is it fixable?
- Are there deals you shouldn't pursue?

```

### Competitive Strategy Options

**How to Compete**

| Strategy | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Differentiate** | Clear unique value | Figma (collaborative) vs Sketch |
| **Niche down** | Can't out-general them | "CRM for real estate" vs Salesforce |
| **Disrupt on price** | Can sustain lower cost | Notion vs Confluence |
| **Out-execute** | Same market, better product | Linear vs Jira |
| **Category creation** | Genuinely new approach | Superhuman (premium email) |

### Competitive Analysis Mistakes

**Common Errors**

```
1. Feature comparison only
   → Features don't capture positioning, experience, trust

2. Ignoring indirect competition
   → Spreadsheets and "do nothing" are competitors too

3. Static analysis
   → Markets change; refresh quarterly

4. Copying winners
   → Following competition means never leading

5. Analysis paralysis
   → Know enough to act, not everything
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Feature chasing** — Adding features because competitors have them
- **Competitor obsession** — Spending more time on them than customers
- **Ignoring non-consumption** — The biggest competitor is often "do nothing"
- **Static battlecards** — Competitive info that's never updated
- **Second-hand intel** — Only hearing about competitors through sales
- **Copying positioning** — Being a worse version of them instead of different
