## Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

**Impact: CRITICAL**

People don't buy products. They hire them to do a job. Understanding the job changes everything about how you build and market.

### The Core Concept

```
"People don't want a quarter-inch drill.
 They want a quarter-inch hole."
    — Theodore Levitt

"Actually, they want to hang a picture.
 Actually, they want to feel at home."
    — JTBD thinking
```

**Traditional View vs JTBD View**

| Traditional | JTBD |
|-------------|------|
| "Who is our customer?" | "What job are they hiring us to do?" |
| Demographics-focused | Progress-focused |
| Competes with similar products | Competes with any alternative |
| Features drive decisions | Outcomes drive decisions |

### Job Anatomy

**A Complete Job Statement**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     COMPLETE JOB                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ WHEN [situation/context]                                │
│ I WANT TO [motivation/action]                           │
│ SO I CAN [expected outcome]                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ FUNCTIONAL JOB: What they're trying to accomplish       │
│ EMOTIONAL JOB: How they want to feel                    │
│ SOCIAL JOB: How they want to be perceived               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example: Project Management Tool**
```
WHEN I'm leading a complex project with multiple stakeholders
I WANT TO see everyone's progress and blockers in one place
SO I CAN keep the project on track and look competent to leadership

Functional: Track project status across team members
Emotional: Feel in control, reduce anxiety about surprises
Social: Appear organized and competent to executives
```

### The Four Forces of Progress

```
                    PUSH OF CURRENT SITUATION
                    (Problems with status quo)
                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│                      SWITCHING                          │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ▲
                              │
                    PULL OF NEW SOLUTION
                    (Attraction of new way)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

                   ANXIETY OF NEW SOLUTION
                   (Fear of change, learning)
                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│                   NOT SWITCHING                         │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ▲
                              │
                   HABIT OF PRESENT
                   (Comfort of status quo)
```

**For Switching to Occur:**
Push + Pull > Anxiety + Habit

### JTBD Interview Technique

**The Timeline**

Map the journey from first thought to purchase:

```
First Thought ─► Passive Looking ─► Active Looking ─► Decision ─► Purchase ─► Use
     │                │                    │              │           │         │
     ▼                ▼                    ▼              ▼           ▼         ▼
"What triggered "Where did you  "What did you   "Why this   "How did    "Is it
 this?"          look?"          compare?"       one?"       you buy?"   working?"
```

**Timeline Interview Questions**

```
First Thought:
"Take me back to when you first started thinking about [solution]."
"What was happening in your life/work at that moment?"
"What pushed you over the edge to start looking?"

Passive Looking:
"What did you do next?"
"Where did you look for solutions?"
"Who did you talk to about this?"

Active Looking:
"When did it become serious?"
"What options did you consider?"
"How did you evaluate them?"

Decision:
"What made you choose [solution]?"
"What almost stopped you?"
"Who else was involved in the decision?"

Use:
"How's it going now?"
"What's better? What's not?"
"Would you make the same choice again?"
```

### Job Mapping

**Break Down the Main Job into Steps**

| Job Step | Customer Action | Potential Pain Points |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Define** | Determine goals | Unclear requirements |
| **Locate** | Find inputs needed | Hard to find resources |
| **Prepare** | Set up for execution | Complex configuration |
| **Confirm** | Verify readiness | Uncertainty about correctness |
| **Execute** | Perform main activity | Difficulty, errors |
| **Monitor** | Track progress | Lack of visibility |
| **Modify** | Make adjustments | Rigid, hard to change |
| **Conclude** | Finish the job | Incomplete, cleanup needed |

**Example: Job = "Prepare for Client Presentation"**

| Step | Action | Pain Points | Opportunity |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Define | Understand what client needs | Unclear expectations | Intake templates |
| Locate | Find relevant data | Data in silos | Unified dashboard |
| Prepare | Build presentation | Manual formatting | Auto-formatting |
| Confirm | Review with team | Async, slow feedback | Real-time collab |
| Execute | Present to client | Technical issues | Reliable platform |
| Monitor | Read room reactions | Hard to gauge virtually | Engagement analytics |
| Modify | Adjust on the fly | Rigid slides | Dynamic content |
| Conclude | Send follow-ups | Manual tracking | Automated actions |

### Competing Solutions (Real Competition)

**Your Real Competitors Are Alternatives, Not Similar Products**

```
Job: "Stay informed about my industry"

Traditional competitors:
- Trade publications
- Industry newsletters

Real competitors (alternatives):
- Twitter/X
- LinkedIn feed
- Podcasts during commute
- Slack communities
- Doing nothing (JOMO)
```

**Competitive Analysis Through JTBD**

| Alternative | Functional Fit | Emotional Fit | Trade-offs |
|------------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Trade publications | High quality | Feel informed | Slow, time-consuming |
| Twitter | Real-time | FOMO, anxiety | Noisy, unreliable |
| Podcasts | Convenient | Passive learning | Can't skim |
| LinkedIn | Professional | Career signaling | Engagement bait |
| Nothing | Zero effort | Relief | Miss important things |

### Outcome Statements

**Write Outcomes, Not Features**

Format: `[Direction] + [Metric] + [Object of Control] + [Context]`

**Good Outcome Statements**
```
"Minimize the time it takes to find relevant information"
"Reduce the likelihood of missing important updates"
"Increase the ability to share insights with colleagues"
"Minimize the effort to stay current on trends"
```

**Bad Outcome Statements**
```
"Easy to use" (vague)
"Has good features" (not outcome)
"Users like it" (not specific)
"Fast" (not measurable)
```

### Opportunity Scoring

**Rate Each Outcome by Importance and Satisfaction**

```
Opportunity = Importance + max(Importance - Satisfaction, 0)
```

| Outcome | Importance (1-10) | Satisfaction (1-10) | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Minimize time to find info | 9 | 4 | 9 + 5 = 14 |
| Reduce missed updates | 8 | 6 | 8 + 2 = 10 |
| Increase sharing ability | 5 | 7 | 5 + 0 = 5 |
| Minimize effort staying current | 7 | 3 | 7 + 4 = 11 |

**Interpretation:**
- Score > 12: Underserved opportunity (gold mine)
- Score 10-12: Opportunity worth exploring
- Score < 10: Adequately served or not important

### JTBD Examples Across Industries

**B2B Software**
```
Job: "When I need to onboard a new team member, I want to give them
      access to everything they need, so I can get them productive
      quickly without creating security risks."

Competitors: Manual processes, IT tickets, spreadsheets, existing IAM tools
```

**Consumer App**
```
Job: "When I have 10 minutes of downtime, I want to feel like I'm
      learning something valuable, so I can feel productive and
      have interesting things to share."

Competitors: Podcasts, Twitter, news apps, YouTube, just resting
```

**B2B Service**
```
Job: "When we're planning our annual budget, I want to understand
      what we're actually spending on software, so I can cut waste
      and justify new investments."

Competitors: Finance team spreadsheets, procurement tools, doing it annually
```

### Common JTBD Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Jobs Too Broad**
```
Bad: "Communicate with my team"
Good: "When I need quick feedback on a decision, get input from
       relevant people without disrupting deep work"
```

**Mistake 2: Jobs Too Narrow**
```
Bad: "Send a Slack message"
Good: "Get quick, informal answers from colleagues"
```

**Mistake 3: Confusing Jobs with Tasks**
```
Task: "Create a report"
Job: "Demonstrate value to stakeholders to secure continued funding"
```

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Emotional/Social Jobs**
```
Functional only: "Manage my calendar"
Complete: "Feel in control of my time and appear reliable to others"
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Feature-first thinking** — Starting with "we could build X" instead of "what job exists"
- **Demographic segmentation** — "Millennials want..." vs "People trying to [job] want..."
- **Ignoring non-consumption** — Not considering why people do nothing
- **Jobs too abstract** — "Make life better" is not a job
- **Skipping the timeline** — Not understanding the journey to purchase
- **Functional-only jobs** — Missing emotional and social dimensions
