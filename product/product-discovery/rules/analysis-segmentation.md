## Customer Segmentation Research

**Impact: HIGH**

Not all customers are equal. Segmentation reveals which customers to prioritize and how to serve them differently.

### Segmentation vs Personas

| Concept | What It Is | Based On | How to Use |
|---------|------------|----------|------------|
| **Segment** | Group of customers with shared characteristics | Data + behavior | Prioritization, positioning |
| **Persona** | Archetype representing a segment | Research synthesis | Design, messaging |
| **ICP** | Ideal customer profile | Best customer analysis | Sales, marketing targeting |

### Segmentation Approaches

**Behavioral Segmentation (Most Valuable)**
```
Segment by what they DO:
- Usage patterns (power user vs casual)
- Purchase behavior (frequency, value)
- Feature adoption (which capabilities)
- Engagement level (active vs dormant)
- Workflow (how they use product)
```

**Needs-Based Segmentation**
```
Segment by what they NEED:
- Primary job-to-be-done
- Must-have vs nice-to-have features
- Success metrics (what does "working" mean?)
- Pain intensity (how urgent)
```

**Firmographic Segmentation (B2B)**
```
Segment by COMPANY characteristics:
- Size (employees, revenue)
- Industry/vertical
- Stage (startup, growth, enterprise)
- Geography
- Tech stack
```

**Demographic Segmentation (B2C)**
```
Segment by PERSON characteristics:
- Age, income, location
- Role, seniority
- Experience level
- Company type (if relevant)
```

### Building Segments from Research

**Step 1: Collect Data**
```
Sources:
- User interviews (qualitative)
- Survey responses (quantitative)
- Product analytics (behavioral)
- CRM data (firmographic)
- Support tickets (pain points)
```

**Step 2: Identify Patterns**
```
Look for clusters around:
- Similar problems/jobs
- Similar behaviors
- Similar outcomes
- Similar objections

Interview notes → Affinity mapping → Pattern recognition
```

**Step 3: Define Segments**

| Segment | Size | Behavior | Needs | Value |
|---------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Power Users** | 15% | Daily use, all features | Advanced capabilities, integrations | High LTV, low support |
| **Task Completers** | 45% | Weekly use, core features | Simplicity, speed | Medium LTV, medium support |
| **Occasional Users** | 30% | Monthly, basic features | Minimal friction | Low LTV, low support |
| **Struggling Users** | 10% | Started, stalled | Hand-holding, guidance | At-risk, high support |

**Step 4: Validate Segments**
```
Validation criteria:
- Identifiable: Can you find them?
- Substantial: Big enough to matter?
- Accessible: Can you reach them?
- Differentiable: Distinct from others?
- Actionable: Can you serve them differently?
```

### Segment Prioritization Matrix

**Score Each Segment**

| Factor | Weight | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Market size** | 25% | TAM for this segment |
| **Revenue potential** | 25% | Willingness to pay × volume |
| **Fit with product** | 20% | How well you solve their problem |
| **Acquisition ease** | 15% | How hard to reach and convert |
| **Strategic value** | 15% | Learning, brand, network effects |

**Example Prioritization**

| Segment | Size | Revenue | Fit | Acquisition | Strategic | Total |
|---------|------|---------|-----|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Startups | 7 | 5 | 9 | 8 | 9 | 7.4 |
| Enterprise | 9 | 10 | 6 | 4 | 7 | 7.3 |
| SMB | 8 | 6 | 7 | 7 | 5 | 6.7 |
| Agencies | 5 | 6 | 8 | 6 | 4 | 5.9 |

### Persona Development

**From Segments to Personas**

```
Segment: "Startups (20-100 employees)"

Persona: "Scaling Sarah"
- Role: Head of Engineering
- Context: Series A startup, growing fast
- Primary job: Ship features while maintaining quality
- Key pain: Technical debt piling up as team grows
- Success metric: Deploy frequency without incidents
- Quote: "I can't slow down to speed up."
```

**Persona Template**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PERSONA NAME: [Descriptive name]                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ROLE: [Job title]                                       │

### Segment-Specific Research

**Research Questions by Segment Stage**

```
New Segment (exploring):
- What jobs are they hiring products for?
- What alternatives do they use today?
- What would make them switch?
- How do they buy? Who's involved?

Existing Segment (deepening):
- What features do they use most/least?
- Where do they get stuck?
- What would make them expand usage?
- What's their actual workflow?

At-Risk Segment (retaining):
- Why did they originally buy?
- What changed?
- What would it take to re-engage?
- What can we learn for other segments?
```

### Multi-Segment Strategy

**Beachhead → Expand**

```
Phase 1: Beachhead
Choose ONE segment to dominate first.
Criteria:
- Easiest to reach
- Fastest sales cycle
- Most forgiving of early product
- Best for learning

Phase 2: Adjacent Expansion
Add segments that:
- Share similar jobs
- Can use same core product
- Don't require major pivots
- Build on existing reputation

Phase 3: Market Coverage
Expand to larger segments that:
- Require product maturity
- Need case studies/proof
- Have longer sales cycles
```

**When to Serve Multiple Segments**

```
Yes, if:
- Core product serves both
- Marginal cost is low
- Segments don't conflict
- You have resources

No, if:
- Requires different products
- Segments have opposing needs
- Spreads team too thin
- One segment is clearly better
```

### Segmentation Anti-Patterns

**Segment by Demographics Alone**
```
Bad: "Small businesses" (too broad, what do they have in common?)
Good: "Growing e-commerce businesses with 10-50 employees struggling
       with inventory management"
```

**Too Many Segments**
```
Bad: 12 personas with nuanced differences
Good: 3-4 distinct segments with clear differentiation
```

**Static Segments**
```
Bad: "We defined personas 2 years ago"
Good: Quarterly review of segment fit and behavior changes
```

**Segment by Wish, Not Reality**
```
Bad: "Enterprise would be great customers"
      (but you've never sold to them)
Good: Segment based on actual customer data
```

### Segment Research Tools

| Tool | Use Case | Data Type |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Interviews** | Deep understanding | Qualitative |
| **Surveys** | Validate segment size | Quantitative |
| **Analytics** | Behavioral patterns | Quantitative |
| **CRM analysis** | Customer attributes | Firmographic |
| **Support tickets** | Pain points by segment | Qualitative |
| **Cohort analysis** | Segment performance | Quantitative |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Segment by convenience** — Using data you have vs data that matters
- **Persona theater** — Beautiful documents no one uses
- **Ignoring negative segments** — Not explicitly deprioritizing bad-fit customers
- **One-size-fits-all** — Same messaging/product for all segments
- **Segment proliferation** — Creating new segments instead of validating existing
- **Demographic obsession** — Age/size over behavior/needs
