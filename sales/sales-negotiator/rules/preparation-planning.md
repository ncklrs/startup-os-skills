## Negotiation Preparation & Planning

**Impact: CRITICAL**

The negotiation is won or lost before you sit down at the table. Preparation is your competitive advantage.

### The Preparation Framework

**ICON Model:**
- **I**nterests — What does each party really want?
- **C**riteria — What standards will guide decisions?
- **O**ptions — What creative solutions exist?
- **N**o-deal — What happens if we walk away?

### Pre-Negotiation Checklist

| Element | Questions to Answer | Source |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Their situation** | Budget cycle? Competitive threats? Recent changes? | News, LinkedIn, 10-K |
| **Decision process** | Who decides? Who influences? Timeline? | Champion intel |
| **Past behavior** | How do they typically negotiate? Precedents? | Industry contacts |
| **Your authority** | What can you approve? When escalate? | Internal alignment |
| **Walk-away point** | At what terms do you leave? | BATNA analysis |

### Issue Matrix Planning

**Map every negotiable item:**

| Issue | Our Priority | Their Priority | Trade Potential |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Price | High | High | Low (both care) |
| Payment terms | Low | High | HIGH (we trade) |
| Implementation | Medium | Low | Medium |
| Contract length | High | Medium | HIGH (we want) |
| Case study rights | Low | Medium | HIGH (we trade) |
| Support SLA | Medium | High | Medium |

### Good Preparation Examples

```
Scenario: Enterprise software negotiation

Good preparation:
- Researched: CFO mentioned "cost optimization" in earnings call
- Discovered: Incumbent contract expires in 6 weeks
- Mapped: IT has veto power, procurement runs process
- Prepared: 3 pricing structures (monthly, annual, 3-year)
- Documented: Competitor pricing benchmarks
- Aligned: Internal approval for 15% max discount
- BATNA: Two other deals in pipeline at full price

Result: Negotiated from strength with multiple options
```

### Bad Preparation Examples

```
Scenario: Same enterprise negotiation

Bad preparation:
- Walked in knowing only the contact's name
- No idea of their budget or timeline
- Assumed champion could approve the deal
- Only one pricing option prepared
- Didn't know competitor pricing
- Had to "check with manager" on every concession

Result: Gave unnecessary discounts, extended timeline
```

### Stakeholder Intelligence Gathering

**Questions for your champion:**
1. Who else will be involved in this decision?
2. What's the approval process look like?
3. What concerns have you heard from others?
4. How have similar purchases been decided?
5. What would make this a clear "yes" for everyone?
6. What's your timeline, and what's driving it?

**Questions for yourself:**
1. What do I know I don't know?
2. What assumptions am I making?
3. What could derail this deal?
4. What's the best outcome for both sides?

### Planning Your Negotiation Narrative

**The story you'll tell:**

```
1. Acknowledge their world
   "Given your growth targets and the pressure on operations..."

2. Connect to their interests
   "...you need a solution that scales without scaling costs..."

3. Position your value
   "...which is exactly what we've done for [similar company]..."

4. Justify your ask
   "...which is why our investment level reflects that outcome."
```

### Time Investment by Deal Size

| Deal Size | Preparation Time | Key Focus |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| <$25K | 1-2 hours | Basic research, single decision maker |
| $25K-$100K | 4-8 hours | Stakeholder map, competitive analysis |
| $100K-$500K | 1-2 days | Deep research, multiple scenarios |
| $500K+ | 1 week+ | Executive alignment, legal prep |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Winging it** — "I know this customer, I don't need to prepare"
- **Over-preparing tactics** — Scripting every response (you'll miss cues)
- **Ignoring their BATNA** — Not knowing their alternatives
- **Assuming alignment** — Not confirming internal authority before negotiating
- **Single scenario** — Only preparing for one outcome
- **Data hoarding** — Gathering intel but not synthesizing it
