## Handling Discount Requests

**Impact: HIGH**

Every discount trains the buyer. How you handle discount requests defines your pricing integrity and future negotiations.

Your job: Figure out which before responding.

### Diagnostic Questions

**Before responding to any discount request:**

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| "Help me understand what's driving this request" | True motivation |
| "What would you need to see to feel confident in this investment?" | Value gap |
| "Is this a budget constraint or a value question?" | Framing approach |
| "If price weren't a factor, would you move forward?" | True objection |
| "What happens if we can't reach agreement on price?" | Their BATNA |

### The Never-Give-Without-Getting Framework

```
NEVER:  "Sure, I can do 15% off"
        (You gave, they took, they'll ask again)

ALWAYS: "I can adjust by 15% if we [trade item]"
        (Value exchange, mutual commitment)
```

### Trade Items for Discounts

| Your Concession | What You Get in Return |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| 5-10% discount | Annual payment (upfront cash) |
| 10-15% discount | Multi-year commitment |
| 10-15% discount | Reduced scope/tier |
| 5-10% discount | Case study + reference calls |
| 5-10% discount | Longer implementation timeline |
| 10-20% discount | Payment terms (net 60 → net 15) |
| Variable | Logo rights for marketing |
| Variable | Introduction to peer companies |

### Good Discount Handling Examples

```
Scenario: "Can you do 20% off?"

Response 1: The Trade
"I can get to a 20% reduction. Here's how we'd do that:
- Move from monthly to annual billing (saves us cost)
- 3-year commitment instead of 1 (reduces our risk)
- You provide a case study after 6 months (marketing value)

If those work for you, I can justify the discount internally.
Which of those would work on your end?"
```

```
Scenario: "Your competitor is 30% cheaper"

Response 2: The Value Reframe
"They may well be. The question is what you're comparing.
We win deals against them regularly at higher prices because
[specific differentiator]. The companies that go with cheaper
solutions often come to us later - and it costs them more
because they have to migrate. What's driving the comparison?"
```

```
Scenario: Budget genuinely constrained

Response 3: The Scope Adjustment
"I respect that budget is firm. Let's look at this differently.
At $80K, I can offer our Growth tier which covers [core needs].
Once you're seeing ROI, we can expand to the full scope.
Would that work as a starting point?"
```

### Bad Discount Handling Examples

```
Scenario: First discount request

Bad response:
"Let me see what I can do. I might be able to get you 10% off."

Why it fails:
- Conceded without understanding why
- Showed you have room (they'll push for more)
- No trade requested
- "Might" shows uncertainty/weakness
```

```
Scenario: Repeat discount requests

Bad response:
"I already gave you 15%. I can maybe do 18%."

Why it fails:
- Rewarded asking twice with more discount
- Established pattern: asking = getting
- No trade for additional concession
- Will keep going
```

### The Discount Ladder

**If you must discount, diminish each step:**

```
Opening price:         $100,000
First concession:      - $8,000 (8%)
Second concession:     - $4,000 (4%)  ← Halving pattern
Third concession:      - $1,500 (1.5%)
"Final" concession:    - $500 (0.5%)
                       ─────────
Ending price:          $86,000

The decreasing pattern signals: "We're approaching the floor"
```

### Response Templates

**"That's too expensive"**
```
"Expensive compared to what? I want to understand your
reference point so I can address the right concern."
```

**"I need 30% off"**
```
"Help me understand what's driving that number. Is it a budget
you're working within, or do you not see the value at our price?"
```

**"Competitor X is cheaper"**
```
"What specifically about their offering are you comparing?
I want to make sure we're looking at apples to apples."
```

**"Can you do any better?"**
```
"Better in what way? If it's about the investment level, tell
me more about what you're working with and I'll see what
options we have."
```

**"I can't approve this amount"**
```
"Who can? I'd rather we get the right people in the room than
have you negotiate something you can't commit to."
```

### Protecting Price Integrity

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Same discount requires same trade | Don't give different customers different terms |
| Document trade rationale | "Discount provided in exchange for..." |
| Don't negotiate twice | Signed terms are final |
| Internal alignment | Know your floor before negotiating |
| Precedent awareness | Today's discount is tomorrow's expectation |

### When to Accept Lower Price

**Valid reasons:**
- Strategic logo/reference customer
- Land-and-expand opportunity with clear path
- Genuine budget constraint with high-value fit
- Market entry/early adopter pricing
- Volume commitment justifies margin compression

**Invalid reasons:**
- Fear of losing the deal
- End of quarter pressure
- They asked nicely
- "We'll make it up on expansion"
- Competitor price matching

### Anti-Patterns

- **Instant discounting** — Discounting before they even ask
- **Discount without trade** — Giving without getting
- **Revealing your floor** — "20% is the absolute most I can do"
- **Escalating discounts** — Rewarding persistence with more off
- **Price matching** — Racing to bottom with competitors
- **Apologizing for price** — "I know it's expensive, but..."
- **Discount as default** — Every deal gets a discount
