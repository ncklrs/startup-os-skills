# Demo Specialist

Strategic expertise for delivering product demonstrations that convert prospects into customers.

## Philosophy

A demo isn't a feature tour. It's a **story about your prospect's future** told through your product.

The best product demos:
1. **Start with their problem** — Not your solution
2. **Show, don't tell** — Features are boring; outcomes are compelling
3. **Match the audience** — Executives need different things than end-users
4. **Create urgency** — Show the cost of inaction
5. **End with a clear next step** — Never let momentum die

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `structure-*` — Demo flow, storytelling arc, timing
- `audience-*` — Stakeholder mapping, persona-based demos
- `technique-*` — Live demo execution, objection handling
- `environment-*` — Demo prep, sandbox vs live, technical setup
- `followup-*` — Post-demo actions, next steps

## Core Frameworks

### The Demo Hierarchy of Needs

```
                ┌─────────────────┐
                │   CONVICTION    │  ← "I need this NOW"
                │   (Urgency)     │
                ├─────────────────┤
                │    VISION       │  ← "I see how this transforms us"
                │   (Future)      │
                ├─────────────────┤
                │   RELEVANCE     │  ← "This solves MY problem"
                │  (Personalized) │
                ├─────────────────┤
                │   CREDIBILITY   │  ← "This actually works"
                │   (Proof)       │
                └─────────────────┘
```

### Demo Structure Arc

```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│  HOOK    │───▶│ PROBLEM  │───▶│ SOLUTION │───▶│  PROOF   │───▶│  CLOSE   │

```

### Stakeholder Demo Matrix

| Stakeholder | Primary Need | Demo Focus | Success Metric |
|-------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| **Executive** | Strategic value, ROI | Business outcomes, dashboards | "How does this move our KPIs?" |
| **Manager** | Team efficiency, reporting | Workflows, collaboration | "How does this make my team faster?" |
| **End User** | Daily workflow, ease of use | UX, common tasks | "How does this make my job easier?" |
| **Technical** | Integration, security, scale | APIs, architecture, compliance | "How does this fit our stack?" |
| **Finance** | Cost, ROI, TCO | Pricing, value metrics | "What's the business case?" |

### The SHOW Framework

- **S**ituation — Confirm their current state
- **H**urdle — Highlight the specific challenge
- **O**utcome — Paint the future with your solution
- **W**ow — Demonstrate the "aha moment"

### Demo Types

| Type | Duration | Audience | Depth | Goal |
|------|----------|----------|-------|------|
| **Teaser** | 5-10 min | Cold leads | Surface | Generate interest |
| **Discovery Demo** | 15-20 min | Qualified leads | Moderate | Validate fit |
| **Full Demo** | 30-45 min | Buying committee | Deep | Advance deal |
| **Technical Deep-Dive** | 45-60 min | IT/Dev team | Very deep | Technical validation |
| **Executive Briefing** | 15-20 min | C-suite | Strategic | Executive buy-in |
| **POC Kickoff** | 60+ min | Project team | Implementation | Start evaluation |

## Environment Strategy

| Environment | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|----------|------|------|
| **Production** | Mature product, confidence | Real data, authentic | Risk of bugs/latency |
| **Sandbox** | Complex demos, new features | Controlled, safe | Less authentic |
| **Customer's Data** | Late-stage deals | Highly relevant | Requires prep |
| **Recorded** | Consistency, scale | Perfect execution | No interaction |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Feature dumping** — Showing everything instead of what matters
- **No discovery** — Demoing before understanding their needs
- **One-size-fits-all** — Same demo for every audience
- **Demo theater** — Overly scripted, no room for questions
- **Technical rabbit holes** — Getting lost in implementation details
- **No next step** — Ending without a clear action
- **Ignoring the room** — Not reading reactions and adjusting
- **Over-promising** — Showing roadmap items as current features
