## Integrating Discovery into Demos

**Impact: CRITICAL**

A demo without discovery is a feature tour. A demo built on discovery is a customized solution presentation. The connection between what you learned and what you show is where demos become deals.

### The Discovery-to-Demo Pipeline

```
DISCOVERY                    DEMO INTEGRATION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pain points          →       Demo flow priorities
Current process      →       "Before vs After" framing
Success metrics      →       ROI/proof point selection
Stakeholder concerns →       Objection preemption
Timeline/urgency     →       Close approach
Competition          →       Differentiation emphasis
```

### Pre-Demo Discovery Review

**Before every demo, answer these:**

```
QUALIFICATION
□ Why are they looking? (Trigger event)
□ Why now? (Urgency/timeline)
□ What's the cost of inaction?
□ Who's involved in the decision?
□ What's the budget situation?

PROBLEM
□ What's the specific pain? (Not generic)
□ Who feels it most? (Person and role)
□ How are they solving it today?
□ What have they tried that failed?

SUCCESS
□ What does success look like to them?
□ What metrics would they track?
□ What's their realistic timeline?

COMPETITION
□ Who else are they evaluating?
□ What do they like about alternatives?
□ What concerns them about alternatives?
```

### Mapping Discovery to Demo Flow

**Create your demo script based on discovery:**

| Discovery Finding | Demo Response |
|-------------------|---------------|
| "We spend 4 hours on X" | "Let me show you the 15-minute version of X" |
| "Our biggest concern is security" | Lead with security/compliance features |
| "We're evaluating [competitor]" | Emphasize differentiators, not feature parity |
| "The CFO needs to see ROI" | Build in ROI calculation/dashboard |
| "Our team is non-technical" | Focus on ease of use, not capabilities |
| "Integration with [tool] is critical" | Demonstrate that integration prominently |

### Discovery Callbacks During Demo

**Reference what you learned constantly:**

```
OPENING CALLBACK:
"Based on our conversation with [AE], I understand
you're dealing with [specific problem]. Today I want
to show you exactly how we solve that."

MID-DEMO CALLBACK:
"This is what [Name] mentioned — your team currently
spends [time] doing [task]. Watch what happens now..."

PROOF CALLBACK:
"You mentioned [competitor concern]. Here's what
[similar customer] found when they compared..."

CLOSE CALLBACK:
"You said [success criteria]. Based on what you've
seen, does this look like it delivers that?"
```

### When Discovery Is Incomplete

**Signs you don't have enough:**
- You don't know the specific problem
- You can't name specific stakeholders
- You don't know their current process
- You don't understand the urgency

**Mid-demo discovery techniques:**

```
OPENING DISCOVERY:
"Before I jump in, I want to make sure I'm showing
you the right things. Can you tell me more about
[specific area]?"

CONFIRMING ASSUMPTIONS:
"I'm assuming [assumption]. Is that right, or is
there something I should adjust?"

MICRO-DISCOVERY:
"How would this typically work in your environment?"
"Who on your team would use this most?"
"What would success look like for this specific workflow?"
```

### Building the Custom Demo Narrative

**The Narrative Formula:**

```
"We understand [company] is dealing with [problem]..."
(Prove you did your homework)

"...which is costing you [quantified impact]..."
(Create urgency)

"...because [root cause]."
(Show understanding)

"What we're going to show you today is how [outcome]..."
(Promise the transformation)

"...specifically focused on [their use cases]."
(Prove customization)
```

**Example:**

```
"We understand Acme Corp is dealing with deployment
cycles that take 4 hours of engineering time, about
80 hours a month total — that's half an FTE.

And from what Sarah shared, the bigger issue isn't
just time — it's the production incidents that come
from manual errors in the current process.

What we're going to show you today is how Acme's
deployment process becomes 15 minutes with zero
manual steps, specifically focused on your Kubernetes
environment and the Salesforce integration you need."
```

### Discovery Gap Handling

**When they reveal new information mid-demo:**

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| New stakeholder concern | "That's important. Let me adjust what I'm showing you..." |
| Different primary use case | "That changes things. Let me show you [alternative flow]..." |
| Undiscovered objection | "I'm glad you brought that up. Let me address it directly..." |
| New competitor in mix | "Good to know. Let me show you how we compare on [differentiator]..." |

**The Pivot Script:**

```
"Actually, based on what you just shared, let me
adjust. [Original plan] is still relevant, but let
me first show you [new priority] since that's more
critical to your decision."
```

### Pre-Demo Questions to Ask

**If you didn't do discovery, do it now:**

```
OPENING (2 minutes)

"Before I show you the product, I want to make sure
I'm focusing on what matters most. Can I ask a few
quick questions?"

1. "What's driving your evaluation right now?"
2. "What does your current process look like for [use case]?"
3. "If this demo is successful, what happens next?"
4. "Is there anything specific you need to see today?"
```

### Stakeholder-Specific Discovery Integration

**For each stakeholder type, connect differently:**

| Stakeholder | Discovery to Reference | Demo to Show |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Executive** | Business outcomes, strategic priorities | ROI dashboards, metrics |
| **Manager** | Team pain points, efficiency goals | Workflow improvements |
| **End User** | Daily frustrations, workflow gaps | Ease of use, time savings |
| **Technical** | Integration requirements, security needs | Architecture, APIs, compliance |
| **Finance** | Budget constraints, ROI requirements | TCO comparison, value metrics |

### The Discovery Validation Loop

**During demo, validate what you learned:**

```
ASSUMPTION: "They said deployment takes 4 hours"

VALIDATION: "Sarah mentioned deployment takes about
4 hours currently. Is that still accurate? Has
anything changed?"

POSSIBLE RESPONSES:
- "Yes, exactly right" → Continue as planned
- "Actually, it's worse now" → Emphasize more
- "We've improved it somewhat" → Adjust framing
- "Different people experience differently" → Explore
```

### Building Discovery into Your Demo System

**Post-demo discovery documentation:**

```
□ What new information did I learn?
□ What assumptions were validated?
□ What assumptions were wrong?
□ What questions remain unanswered?
□ What objections need addressing?
□ What should the next conversation explore?
```

**Feed back to discovery process:**

| Demo Learning | Discovery Update |
|---------------|------------------|
| New stakeholder emerged | Add to stakeholder map |
| New use case mentioned | Add to requirements |
| New objection raised | Prep for next call |
| Competition mentioned | Research competitor |
| Timeline shifted | Update deal stage |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Generic demo despite discovery** — Wasting the intelligence you gathered
- **No discovery callbacks** — Not proving you listened
- **Assuming discovery is complete** — Things change
- **Not adapting mid-demo** — Rigid despite new information
- **Over-relying on AE notes** — Not confirming with attendees
- **Discovery without integration** — Great questions, same demo
- **Skipping discovery entirely** — Feature tour mode
- **Not documenting new learnings** — Losing deal intelligence
