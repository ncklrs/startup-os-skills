## Demo Follow-up and Next Steps

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

The demo ends when they say yes, not when you stop sharing your screen. What happens in the 24-48 hours after a demo often determines whether the deal moves forward or stalls.

### The Demo Close Framework

**Before ending the demo:**

```
STEP 1: SUMMARIZE (30 sec)
"So today we covered three things:
 1. [Key capability 1] that addresses [their problem]
 2. [Key capability 2] that enables [their goal]
 3. [Key capability 3] that differentiates us from [alternative]"

STEP 2: CONFIRM VALUE (30 sec)
"Based on what you've seen, does this look like it would
solve the [specific problem] we discussed?"

[Wait for response]

STEP 3: PROPOSE NEXT STEP (30 sec)
"The logical next step would be [specific action]. I have
[day/time] open this week — does that work?"

STEP 4: TIMELINE CONTEXT (15 sec)
"If we move forward, you could be live by [realistic date]."
```

### Next Step Options

| Deal Stage | Appropriate Next Step | Ownership |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Early (Teaser demo)** | Discovery call with AE | AE books |
| **Mid (Discovery demo)** | Full demo with stakeholders | You propose |
| **Late (Full demo)** | Technical validation / POC | Joint proposal |
| **Final (POC review)** | Proposal / commercial discussion | AE drives |

### The 24-Hour Follow-Up

**Email Template:**

### Follow-Up Timing Framework

| Action | Timing | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|

### Handling Common Post-Demo Situations

**Situation: They went dark**

```
Day 5 email:
"Hi [Name], I wanted to follow up on our conversation
last week. I know these decisions involve multiple
stakeholders — is there anything I can provide that
would help move the conversation forward internally?"

Day 10 email:
"Hi [Name], I want to be respectful of your time.
Would it be helpful if I:
a) Connected with someone else on your team?
b) Sent over additional technical documentation?
c) Scheduled a follow-up in a few weeks?

Let me know what works best for your timeline."
```

**Situation: Need to involve more stakeholders**

```
"Happy to include [other stakeholders]. Would it be
helpful to schedule a brief session specifically for
[technical team / executives / etc.]? I can tailor
that conversation to what they'd need to see.

Alternatively, I can send the recording from our
session with a summary for them to review."
```

**Situation: They want to see competitors first**

```
"Completely understand — it makes sense to evaluate
options. A few things that might help your comparison:

1. Here's what customers typically compare [link]
2. Here's our honest perspective on when [competitor]
   might be a better fit [differentiation statement]
3. I'm happy to answer any questions that come up
   during your evaluation

When do you expect to complete your review? I'd love
to reconnect afterward."
```

**Situation: Budget/timing isn't right**

```
"I appreciate you being transparent about timing. Let's
do this — I'll reach back out in [timeframe], and in
the meantime, I'll send you some resources that might
be helpful:

• [Case study on ROI]
• [Calculator for building business case]
• [Content about the problem space]

Is there a better time in [Q/year] to reconnect?"
```

### Post-Demo Internal Sync

**After every demo, document:**

```
DEAL INTELLIGENCE
□ Attendees and roles
□ Key pain points validated
□ Features/capabilities that resonated
□ Objections raised and how handled
□ Competition mentioned
□ Timeline/urgency signals
□ Budget indicators
□ Decision process clarified

NEXT STEPS
□ What was agreed
□ Who owns what
□ When it should happen
□ What could block progress

RED FLAGS
□ Low engagement from key stakeholder
□ New requirements surfaced
□ Pricing/timing concerns
□ Political dynamics
```

### Champion Enablement

**Your champion needs ammunition. Provide:**

| Asset | Purpose | Format |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **One-pager** | Quick internal share | PDF |
| **Demo recording** | Show others what they saw | Video link |
| **ROI calculator** | Build business case | Spreadsheet |
| **Security doc** | Answer IT questions | PDF |
| **Comparison sheet** | Address competition | PDF |
| **Implementation plan** | Show it's doable | Doc |

**Champion coaching:**
```
"[Name], you mentioned needing to get [CFO] on board.
What would be most helpful for that conversation?
I can provide:

• A 5-minute executive summary video
• ROI analysis specific to your numbers
• References from similar companies

What would move the needle with [CFO]?"
```

### Momentum Maintenance

**Keep deals alive between steps:**

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Value-add content** | "Saw this article about [their industry], thought you'd find it relevant" |
| **Product news** | "Just shipped a feature related to what you asked about" |
| **Social proof** | "[Company like theirs] just went live — thought you'd want to see the results" |
| **Event invitation** | "We're hosting a webinar on [relevant topic] — you might enjoy it" |
| **Milestone trigger** | "Congrats on [their company news]. Does this change your timeline?" |

### Following Up on Stalled Deals

**The 3-3-3 Rule:**
- 3 value touches
- 3 check-in touches
- 3 break-up touches

```
TOUCH 1-3: VALUE
Send relevant content without asking for anything

TOUCH 4-6: CHECK-IN
"How is [project/initiative] going? Any questions I can answer?"

TOUCH 7-9: BREAK-UP
"I haven't heard back and want to respect your inbox.
I'll assume timing isn't right and will check in next
[quarter]. If anything changes before then, I'm here."
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **No recap email** — Leaving demo to memory
- **Generic follow-up** — Not personalized to conversation
- **Slow response** — Taking days to answer their questions
- **Vague next step** — "Let's talk soon" vs specific date
- **Over-following-up** — 5 emails in a week
- **Abandoning too fast** — Giving up after 2 touches
- **Not enabling champion** — Leaving them without tools
- **No internal documentation** — Losing deal intelligence
