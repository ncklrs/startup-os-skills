## Demo Storytelling Arc

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Every great demo follows a narrative structure. You're not showing features — you're telling a story where your prospect is the hero and your product is the guide.

### The 5-Act Demo Structure

| Act | Duration | Purpose | Key Question Answered |
|-----|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **1. Hook** | 2 min | Capture attention, set agenda | "Why should I pay attention?" |
| **2. Problem** | 5 min | Validate pain, create tension | "Do you understand my struggle?" |
| **3. Solution** | 15 min | Show the transformation | "How does this actually work?" |
| **4. Proof** | 5 min | Build confidence | "Can I trust this will work for us?" |
| **5. Close** | 3 min | Drive action | "What happens next?" |

### Act 1: The Hook (2 minutes)

**Goal:** Earn the right to their attention.

**Elements:**
- Acknowledge their time is valuable
- State the outcome they'll see (not features)
- Confirm agenda and timing
- Ask permission to proceed

**Good Hook:**
```
"Thanks for joining today. By the end of this 30 minutes,
you'll see exactly how [Company] can cut your deployment
time from 4 hours to 15 minutes — with zero additional
headcount. I'll show you the three workflows that matter
most based on what [AE Name] shared from your discovery
call. Does that work, or is there something specific
you'd like me to cover?"
```

**Bad Hook:**
```
"Thanks for joining. I'm going to walk you through our
platform today. We have a lot of features to cover so
let's get started. Here's our home screen..."
```

### Act 2: The Problem (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Make them feel the pain before showing the cure.

**Techniques:**
- Recap what you learned in discovery
- Ask confirming questions
- Quantify the cost of the problem
- Build emotional tension

**Problem Validation Script:**
```
"From our last conversation, I understand that your team
spends about 4 hours on each deployment, and you're doing
roughly 20 deployments a month. That's 80 hours of
engineering time — about half an FTE. And [Name] mentioned
the real cost isn't just time — it's the 2-3 production
incidents per quarter that come from manual errors.
Am I capturing that correctly?"

[PAUSE FOR CONFIRMATION]

"And you mentioned the bigger picture is that this is
blocking your ability to ship the features your customers
are asking for. Your roadmap is backing up because
releases take so long. Is that still the case?"
```

### Act 3: The Solution (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Transform their world through your product.

**The 3-3-3 Rule:**
- Show 3 core workflows maximum
- Spend 3-5 minutes on each
- Connect each to 3 specific benefits they mentioned

**Solution Flow:**

```
For each workflow:

1. SETUP (30 sec)
   "Let me show you how [workflow] works..."

2. CONTEXT (30 sec)
   "This is what [Persona] would see when they need to..."

3. ACTION (2-3 min)
   Actually perform the action in real-time

4. OUTCOME (1 min)
   "And now [result]. This is what [Name] mentioned
    would save your team [X hours/dollars]."

5. BRIDGE (30 sec)
   "That connects to the next thing I want to show you..."
```

### Act 4: The Proof (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Eliminate doubt with evidence.

**Proof Elements:**

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Similar customer** | Always | "Acme Corp had this exact problem..." |
| **Metrics** | ROI-focused buyers | "Average customer sees 47% reduction in..." |
| **Quote/Testimonial** | Trust-building | "Their CTO said..." |
| **Live data** | Technical validation | "Let me show you actual performance..." |
| **Case study** | Complex sales | "I'll send you their full story..." |

### Act 5: The Close (3 minutes)

**Goal:** Create forward momentum.

**Closing Framework:**
```
1. SUMMARIZE
   "So today we saw [3 key things] that would help you
    [achieve outcome]."

2. CONFIRM VALUE
   "Does this look like it would solve the [problem]
    we discussed?"

3. NEXT STEP
   "The logical next step would be [specific action].
    Does [specific date/time] work to [next action]?"

4. TIMELINE
   "If everything goes well, you could be live by [date]."
```

### Timing Discipline

| Demo Length | Hook | Problem | Solution | Proof | Close |
|-------------|------|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| **15 min** | 1 min | 2 min | 8 min | 2 min | 2 min |
| **30 min** | 2 min | 5 min | 15 min | 5 min | 3 min |
| **45 min** | 3 min | 7 min | 25 min | 7 min | 3 min |
| **60 min** | 3 min | 10 min | 35 min | 8 min | 4 min |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Starting with "About Us"** — They don't care about your company yet
- **Feature-first structure** — "First I'll show login, then dashboard..."
- **No problem validation** — Jumping straight to solution
- **Rushed close** — Running out of time for next steps
- **All solution, no proof** — Missing social proof and metrics
- **Linear walkthrough** — Following the UI instead of their workflow
