## Live Demo Execution Techniques

**Impact: HIGH**

The difference between a good demo and a great demo is execution. Same content, same features, wildly different outcomes based on how you deliver.

### The Demo Presenter Mindset

```
You are not:                    You are:
- A feature tour guide          - A trusted advisor
- An order taker               - A problem solver
- A script reader              - A storyteller
- A product expert only        - A business consultant
```

### Pacing and Timing

**The Demo Rhythm:**

| Moment | Pace | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Hook/Problem** | Moderate | Build connection |
| **Aha moments** | Slow down | Let it land |
| **Transitions** | Pause | Allow processing |
| **Routine tasks** | Speed up | Don't bore them |
| **Questions** | Pause before answering | Shows you're thinking |
| **Close** | Deliberate | Create weight |

**Timing Markers:**

```
5 min in:   Check engagement, adjust if needed
10 min in:  First major value demonstration should be done
Halfway:    Brief pause — "How are we doing on time?"
5 min left: Wrap solution section, move to close
End:        Never go over without permission
```

### Narration Techniques

**1. Think-Aloud Narration**

```
DON'T: [Silent clicking]

DO:    "Now I'm going to create a new campaign...
        I'll select our target segment here...
        And watch what happens when I hit 'Launch'..."
```

**2. Outcome-First Narration**

```
DON'T: "First, click here, then here, then select this..."

DO:    "In about 30 seconds, you're going to see a full
        pipeline report generated automatically. Let me
        show you how your team would do this... [click]
        And there it is."
```

**3. Callback Narration**

```
"This is exactly what Sarah mentioned in our discovery
call — the manual process that takes 4 hours. Watch
how this happens now... [demo]... Four minutes."
```

### Screen Management

**The Three-Window Rule:**
- Maximum 3 browser tabs/windows visible
- Close everything not needed before demo
- Pre-load pages to avoid wait times

**Screen Layout:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DEMO ENVIRONMENT                            │
│ (Full screen or 80% of screen)              │
│                                             │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐
│ NOTES/SCRIPT   │    │ ATTENDEE VIEW        │
│ (If needed)    │    │ (If remote)          │
└────────────────┘    └──────────────────────┘
```

**Navigation Best Practices:**

| Action | Good Practice |
|--------|---------------|
| Clicking | Narrate before clicking, pause after |
| Scrolling | Slow, deliberate scrolling |
| Typing | Type at normal speed, not rushed |
| Waiting | Fill loading time with context |
| Zooming | Use when showing detail, announce it |

### Handling Technical Issues

**Preparation Checklist:**

```
□ Test demo environment 1 hour before
□ Close unnecessary applications
□ Disable notifications (Slack, email, system)
□ Check internet connection/backup hotspot
□ Have backup screenshots/video ready
□ Know the recovery plan for each section
```

**When Things Break:**

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| **Page won't load** | "Let me try refreshing. While that loads, let me tell you about [related story]..." |
| **Feature errors** | "That's unusual — let me show you this a different way. [Switch to backup]" |
| **Data looks wrong** | "Hmm, that's not typical. Let me [fix it or explain]" |
| **Internet drops** | "Looks like we hit a connectivity issue. [Switch to phone hotspot / use backup]" |
| **Can't recover** | "I want to respect your time. Let me schedule a follow-up to show you this properly, and let me send you [recording/screenshots] now." |

**The Magic Phrase:**
```
"This is actually a great opportunity to show you how
responsive our support team is. Let me [action]."
```

### Engagement Techniques

**1. Planned Checkpoints**

```
Every 5-7 minutes:

"Does this make sense so far?"
"Is this what you were hoping to see?"
"Should I go deeper here or move on?"
"What questions are coming up for you?"
```

**2. Interactive Moments**

```
"What would you do next here?"
"Take a guess — what do you think happens when I click this?"
"If you were your end user, what would you want to see?"
```

**3. Collaborative Problem-Solving**

```
"Let's say [prospect's scenario] — how would you handle
that today? Let me show you how that same scenario
works in [product]..."
```

### The Art of the Pause

**When to pause:**

| Situation | Pause Duration | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| After asking a question | 3-5 seconds | Let them think |
| After showing "aha" moment | 2-3 seconds | Let it sink in |
| After they ask a question | 2 seconds | Show you're considering |
| Before making a key point | 1-2 seconds | Build anticipation |
| After handling objection | 2-3 seconds | Confirm resolution |

### Voice and Presence

**Vocal Variety:**

| Element | Range | Impact |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Volume** | Louder for key points, softer for confidential/intimate | Emphasis |
| **Speed** | Faster for routine, slower for important | Attention |
| **Tone** | Warm for relationship, direct for business | Trust |
| **Pauses** | Strategic silence | Weight |

**Energy Management:**

```
Start:      80% energy (confident, warm)
Problem:    70% energy (empathetic, serious)
Solution:   90% energy (excited, passionate)
Proof:      80% energy (assured, credible)
Close:      85% energy (confident, expectant)
```

### Recovery from Mistakes

**Minor mistake (typo, wrong click):**
```
Light acknowledgment: "Let me get that right..."
[Fix and continue]
```

**Moderate mistake (showed wrong thing, wrong data):**
```
"Good catch — that's not what I meant to show. Let me
actually show you the correct [thing]..."
```

**Major mistake (broke something, wrong demo entirely):**
```
"I appreciate your patience — that's not the experience
I wanted to show you. Let me [fix / switch to backup].
I'll make sure to follow up with the full demonstration
via [recording / second call]."
```

### Ending Strong

**The Last 60 Seconds:**

```
0:45 - Summarize (3 key points)
0:30 - Confirm value ("Does this solve [problem]?")
0:15 - Next step ("The logical next step is...")
0:00 - Commitment ("Can we schedule [action] for [date]?")
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Apology loop** — "Sorry, let me just... sorry, that's not..."
- **Feature racing** — Clicking so fast no one can follow
- **Reading slides** — Instead of talking with them
- **Silence while clicking** — No narration
- **Clock watching** — Visible anxiety about time
- **Over-recovery** — Spending 5 minutes on a 30-second issue
- **Energy flatline** — Same tone throughout
- **Not reading the room** — Missing obvious signals
