## Demo Timing and Pacing

**Impact: HIGH**

Time is the most precious resource in a demo. Master the clock, and you control the outcome. Let time control you, and you'll always be rushing through your close.

### The Golden Rules of Demo Timing

```
RULE 1: Never run over without permission
RULE 2: Leave 20% buffer for questions
RULE 3: Most important content in first 60%
RULE 4: Close should never be rushed
RULE 5: Better to end early than run long
```

### Time Allocation by Demo Length

**15-Minute Demo (Teaser)**

| Segment | Minutes | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hook + agenda | 1 | Set expectations |
| Problem validation | 2 | Confirm pain |
| Core solution (ONE workflow) | 7 | Primary value |
| Quick proof point | 2 | Credibility |
| Close + next step | 3 | Advance deal |

**30-Minute Demo (Discovery)**

| Segment | Minutes | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hook + agenda | 2 | Set expectations |
| Problem validation | 4 | Confirm and quantify pain |
| Solution (2-3 workflows) | 14 | Demonstrate fit |
| Proof (case study, metrics) | 5 | Build confidence |
| Q&A buffer | 2 | Address concerns |
| Close + next step | 3 | Advance deal |

**45-Minute Demo (Full)**

| Segment | Minutes | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hook + agenda | 3 | Set expectations, confirm goals |
| Problem validation | 5 | Deep pain discussion |
| Solution (3-4 workflows) | 20 | Comprehensive value demo |
| Proof (multiple proof points) | 8 | Build confidence |
| Q&A buffer | 5 | Address concerns |
| Close + next step | 4 | Advance deal with timeline |

**60-Minute Demo (Enterprise)**

| Segment | Minutes | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hook + agenda + intros | 5 | Set expectations, stakeholder alignment |
| Problem validation | 8 | Comprehensive pain discussion |
| Solution (4-5 workflows) | 28 | Deep product demonstration |
| Proof (case studies, ROI) | 10 | Multiple proof points |
| Q&A + technical discussion | 5 | Deep questions |
| Close + next step + timeline | 4 | Clear advancement path |

### Pacing Patterns

**The Energy Wave:**

```
ENERGY
High  │     *****     *****
      │    *     *   *     *   ***
      │   *       * *       * *
      │  *         *         *
Low   │ *
      └─────────────────────────────
        Open  Problem  Solution  Close

Start strong, dip for problem empathy,
peak at solution "aha" moments,
finish with confident close
```

**Speed Variations:**

| Content Type | Pace | Why |
|--------------|------|-----|
| **Hook** | Moderate | Build connection |
| **Problem** | Slower | Let them feel it |
| **Routine navigation** | Fast | Don't bore them |
| **"Aha" moments** | Slow | Let it land |
| **Feature mention** | Fast | Keep moving |
| **Benefit explanation** | Slow | Ensure understanding |
| **Transitions** | Pause | Processing time |
| **Close** | Deliberate | Create weight |

### Time Check Techniques

**Built-in checkpoints:**

```
10-MINUTE MARK:
"We're about 10 minutes in. I want to make sure we
have time for [remaining topics]. Are we on track,
or should I adjust?"

HALFWAY POINT:
"We're at the halfway point. Good time to check —
any questions before we continue? And is there anything
I should prioritize in the back half?"

5 MINUTES REMAINING:
"I want to be respectful of your time. Let me make
sure we cover [close] before we wrap."
```

**When running behind:**

```
OPTION 1: Get permission
"I want to make sure I show you [important thing],
but we're a bit over. Can you stay 5 more minutes,
or should I schedule a follow-up?"

OPTION 2: Prioritize ruthlessly
"In the interest of time, let me skip to [most
important remaining thing] and save [other thing]
for our next conversation."

OPTION 3: Offer asynchronous
"Let me send you a 5-minute video covering [topic]
so we can stay on schedule today."
```

### Managing Different Stakeholder Time

**When stakeholders have different availability:**

```
EXECUTIVES LEAVING EARLY:
Structure the demo so executive-relevant content
(ROI, strategic value, dashboards) is in first third.

"[Executive Name], I know your time is limited.
In the first 10 minutes, I'll show you the strategic
view. The team can stay for the deeper dive if
you need to drop off."

TECHNICAL DEEP-DIVE NEEDED:
Save detailed technical content for a separate call.

"I could spend 30 minutes on our API alone. Let's
schedule a technical deep-dive with your engineers
so we can give it proper attention."
```

### The Question Time Trade-off

**Question handling impact on time:**

| Question Type | Time Impact | How to Handle |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Quick clarification | 30 sec | Answer inline |
| Medium question | 1-2 min | Answer briefly, offer to follow up |
| Deep technical | 5+ min | Defer to parking lot / separate call |
| Off-topic | Variable | Acknowledge, redirect |

**Parking lot time management:**
```
"Let me add that to our parking lot. If we have time
at the end, we'll address it. Otherwise, I'll follow
up via email with the detailed answer."
```

### Timing Signals to Watch

| Signal | Meaning | Response |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Eyes on clock/phone | Losing patience | Speed up, check in |
| "We have hard stop at X" | Firm deadline | Adjust immediately |
| "Can you show X quickly?" | Want specific thing | Pivot to their priority |
| Lots of engagement/questions | Good sign but time risk | Manage, don't suppress |
| "This is great, but..." | Wants you to move on | Pivot quickly |

### Preparation for Time Mastery

**Before every demo:**

```
□ Know exactly how long each section takes
□ Identify what can be cut if needed
□ Identify what must be shown no matter what
□ Have a 10-minute version ready
□ Have a 20-minute version ready
□ Know your cut points (where you can gracefully exit)
```

**The "minimum viable demo":**
```
If you only had 10 minutes, what would you show?

1. [Primary value prop — 5 minutes]
2. [Proof point — 2 minutes]
3. [Close — 3 minutes]

Know this cold. Use it when time gets tight.
```

### Recovering from Time Disasters

**When you're 10+ minutes behind:**

```
"I realize I've taken us deep into [topic], and I
want to respect your time. Let me do two things:

1. Quickly show you [one critical thing]
2. Schedule a follow-up for [remaining content]

Would [day/time] work to continue?"
```

**When they cut the meeting short:**

```
"Understood. Before you go, I want to leave you with
one thing: [most important point]. I'll send a
recording of what we didn't cover, and let's
reconnect [proposed time]."
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **No agenda timing** — Going in without time plan
- **Feature wandering** — Getting lost in tangents
- **Q&A death spiral** — Questions eat all time
- **Rushed close** — Running out of time for next steps
- **Running over without asking** — Disrespects their time
- **Same pace throughout** — Monotonous delivery
- **No buffer** — Planning 30 min of content for 30 min call
- **Not knowing cut points** — Can't adapt when time shifts
