## Objection Handling During Demos

**Impact: HIGH**

Objections during demos are buying signals. They mean the prospect is engaged enough to think critically. Handle them well, and you strengthen the deal. Handle them poorly, and you lose trust.

### The Objection Framework: LAER

```
L - LISTEN    → Hear the full objection without interrupting
A - ACKNOWLEDGE → Validate their concern is reasonable
E - EXPLORE   → Understand the root cause with questions
R - RESPOND   → Address with facts, proof, or reframing
```

### Common Demo Objections by Category

**Price/Value Objections:**

| Objection | Root Cause | Response Strategy |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| "It's too expensive" | Value not clear | Reframe to ROI and cost of inaction |
| "We don't have budget" | Priority/timing issue | Explore if real or excuse, discuss business case |
| "Competitor X is cheaper" | Price comparison | Differentiate on value, TCO, or risk |

**Capability Objections:**

| Objection | Root Cause | Response Strategy |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| "Can it do X?" | Feature question | Show it, or explain workaround/roadmap |
| "We need Y integration" | Technical requirement | Show integration or discuss timeline |
| "That's not how we work" | Workflow mismatch | Explore flexibility, show configuration |

**Trust Objections:**

| Objection | Root Cause | Response Strategy |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| "How do we know it works?" | Need proof | Share case studies, offer POC |
| "What about security?" | Risk concern | Show certifications, compliance docs |
| "What if you go out of business?" | Vendor risk | Share funding, customer base, stability |

**Timing Objections:**

| Objection | Root Cause | Response Strategy |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| "We're not ready yet" | Priorities/resources | Understand timeline, maintain relationship |
| "We just signed with X" | Recent decision | Plant seeds, offer to stay in touch |
| "We're in the middle of Y" | Competing initiative | Find synergy or agree on future timing |

### Objection Response Scripts

**"It's too expensive"**

```
LISTEN:     [Let them finish]

ACKNOWLEDGE: "Price is definitely an important consideration,
             and I appreciate you being direct about it."

EXPLORE:    "Help me understand — when you say expensive,
             is it the total investment, the per-user cost,
             or the timing of the spend?"

RESPOND:    [Based on their answer]

             If ROI unclear:
             "Let me put it in context. You mentioned
             [problem] costs you [X hours/dollars] per
             [period]. At [price], you'd break even in
             [timeframe], and everything after that is
             return. Does that math work for your team?"

             If budget timing:
             "Would it help to look at quarterly billing
             or starting with a smaller scope to fit
             this fiscal year's budget?"
```

**"We need [feature you don't have]"**

```
LISTEN:     [Understand the specific need]

ACKNOWLEDGE: "That's a fair requirement. I want to be
             honest about where we are with that."

EXPLORE:    "Can you help me understand how critical
             that is? Is it a must-have for launch, or
             something you'd need eventually?"

RESPOND:    [Depends on situation]

             If on roadmap:
             "That's on our roadmap for [quarter]. For
             most customers, [workaround] handles this
             in the interim. Would that work for your
             timeline?"

             If not planned:
             "We don't have that today and it's not on
             our immediate roadmap. However, [alternative
             approach]. Would that solve the underlying
             problem you're trying to address?"

             If genuinely blocking:
             "I want to be honest — if that's truly a
             must-have, we may not be the right fit
             today. But let me share what [similar
             customer] did in a similar situation..."
```

**"Competitor X does this better"**

```
LISTEN:     [Understand which competitor, which feature]

ACKNOWLEDGE: "I'm glad you're doing thorough research.
             [Competitor] is a solid product."

EXPLORE:    "What specifically stands out about their
             approach to [feature]? I want to make sure
             I'm comparing apples to apples."

RESPOND:    "Here's how I'd think about it. [Competitor]
             does [X] well. Where we differentiate is
             [Y], which is why [customer type] typically
             chooses us. The question is which of those
             is more important for [their specific use case].

             [Pause for their input]

             Let me show you [our differentiated approach]
             so you can compare directly."
```

### Objection Handling Techniques

**1. The Feel, Felt, Found**

```
"I understand how you feel. [Similar company] felt
the same way initially. What they found was [positive
outcome]. Would you like to hear about their experience?"
```

**2. The Isolation Technique**

```
"If we could solve [specific objection], would everything
else we've discussed work for your team?"
```

**3. The Reframe**

```
Objection: "The learning curve seems steep."

Reframe:   "You're right that there's learning involved.
            The question is: what's the cost of your team
            spending another year with [current painful
            process] vs. investing 2 weeks in training
            and then having [better outcome] forever?"
```

**4. The Third-Party Story**

```
"[Similar company] had the exact same concern. Here's
what happened... [story with positive outcome]"
```

### Parking Lot Technique

**When objection is valid but derailing:**

```
"That's an important point and I want to give it proper
attention. Can I note that down and circle back to it
after I show you [current topic]? I don't want to
shortchange either topic."
```

**When to use:**
- Technical deep-dive questions during executive demo
- Price discussions before value is established
- Feature requests that need product team input

### Reading Objection Severity

| Signal | Meaning | Response |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Asked once, moved on | Minor concern | Address briefly, continue |
| Repeated multiple times | Major concern | Stop and fully address |
| Asked with emotion | Strong feeling | Acknowledge emotion first |
| Asked by decision maker | Deal-critical | Make it priority |
| Asked privately after | Political concern | Address 1:1 |

### Objections That Aren't Really Objections

| What They Say | What They Mean | What to Do |
|---------------|----------------|------------|
| "Let me think about it" | "I'm not convinced yet" | "What would help you think through this?" |
| "Send me more info" | "I'm politely ending this" | "Happy to — what specifically would be useful?" |
| "We need to talk internally" | "There's politics" | "Would it help if I joined that conversation?" |
| "Interesting" | "Meh" | "What would make this more than interesting?" |

### Turning Objections into Commitments

```
After successfully handling objection:

"So if we can confirm [what you just addressed], and
[other requirements], would you be ready to move
forward with [next step]?"
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Getting defensive** — Taking objections personally
- **Arguing** — Trying to prove them wrong
- **Dismissing** — "That's not really an issue"
- **Over-handling** — Going on too long after it's resolved
- **Not confirming** — Moving on without checking if resolved
- **Ignoring red flags** — Plowing ahead despite clear blockers
- **Feature promising** — Committing to unplanned features
- **Badmouthing competitors** — Unprofessional and backfires
