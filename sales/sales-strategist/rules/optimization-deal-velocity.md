## Deal Velocity Optimization

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Deal velocity measures how fast revenue moves through your pipeline. Faster cycles mean more deals per rep per year, better forecasting, and reduced risk of deals dying. Even small velocity improvements compound significantly.

### Deal Velocity Formula

```
Sales Velocity = (# of Opportunities × Average Deal Size × Win Rate) / Sales Cycle Length

Example:
- Opportunities: 100
- Deal Size: $50,000
- Win Rate: 25%
- Cycle Length: 60 days

Velocity = (100 × $50,000 × 0.25) / 60 = $20,833/day

Improving cycle by 10 days:
Velocity = (100 × $50,000 × 0.25) / 50 = $25,000/day
= 20% increase in revenue velocity
```

### Measuring Sales Cycle

**Calculation Methods:**

| Method | Definition | Use Case |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Created → Closed** | From opportunity creation | Overall pipeline efficiency |
| **First Touch → Closed** | From first prospect contact | Full customer journey |
| **Qualified → Closed** | From qualification | Sales-controlled cycle |
| **Stage-to-Stage** | Between each stage | Identify bottlenecks |

**Benchmark Cycles by Segment:**

| Segment | Average Cycle | Top Quartile |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| SMB (<$10K) | 14-30 days | <14 days |
| Mid-Market ($10K-$50K) | 30-60 days | <30 days |
| Mid-Market ($50K-$100K) | 60-90 days | <45 days |
| Enterprise ($100K-$250K) | 90-180 days | <90 days |
| Enterprise ($250K+) | 180-365 days | <180 days |

### Stage Velocity Analysis

**Identify Bottlenecks:**

```
STAGE VELOCITY ANALYSIS

Stage            | Avg Days | Target | Status  | Bottleneck?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Discovery        | 8        | 7      | OK      |
Qualified        | 15       | 10     | SLOW    | ← Bottleneck
Evaluation       | 25       | 20     | SLOW    | ← Bottleneck
Proposal         | 12       | 10     | OK      |
Negotiation      | 8        | 7      | OK      |
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total            | 68       | 54     | +14 days behind target

Analysis:
- Qualified stage: Taking too long to schedule evaluation
  → Action: Implement same-week evaluation scheduling
- Evaluation stage: POC running long
  → Action: Reduce POC scope, 2-week max duration
```

### Velocity by Dimension

**Track Multiple Cuts:**

```
Velocity Dashboard:

By Rep:
├── Rep A: 45 days (Fast)
├── Rep B: 58 days (Average)
├── Rep C: 62 days (Average)
├── Rep D: 78 days (Slow)   ← Coach on pacing
└── Rep E: 92 days (Slow)   ← Coach on pacing

By Source:
├── Inbound: 42 days (Faster - higher intent)
├── Outbound: 68 days (Slower - building need)
└── Partner: 55 days (Medium)

By Deal Size:
├── <$25K: 32 days
├── $25K-$50K: 55 days
├── $50K-$100K: 78 days
└── $100K+: 110 days

By Industry:
├── Tech: 45 days (Fastest - quick decisions)
├── Finance: 72 days (Compliance adds time)
├── Healthcare: 85 days (Slowest - procurement)
└── Retail: 50 days
```

### Acceleration Tactics

**By Stage:**

| Stage | Common Delay | Acceleration Tactic |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Discovery → Qualified** | Scheduling follow-up | Book next meeting in current call |
| **Qualified → Evaluation** | Internal alignment | Multi-thread from day 1 |
| **Evaluation → Proposal** | POC scope creep | Time-boxed, success criteria upfront |
| **Proposal → Negotiation** | Internal review | Pre-share pricing range early |
| **Negotiation → Close** | Legal/procurement | Mutual close plan, known redlines |

**Quick Wins:**

```
Immediate Acceleration Actions:

1. "Book the Next Meeting"
   Before ending any call, book the next step
   Impact: Saves 3-5 days per stage

2. "Compressed Timelines by Default"
   Propose aggressive timelines, let them negotiate
   "Can we schedule the POC for next week?"
   Impact: 20-30% cycle reduction

3. "Mutual Action Plan"
   Shared document with dates and owners
   Creates accountability, surfaces blockers early
   Impact: 15-20% cycle reduction

4. "POC Time-Boxing"
   "Our POCs are 2 weeks. Here's why that's enough..."
   Impact: Reduces 4-week POCs to 2 weeks

5. "Early Legal Engagement"
   Send MSA at proposal stage, not negotiation
   Impact: Saves 1-2 weeks in legal review
```

MILESTONES

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Week 1     | Discovery call         | [AE]       | Complete
Week 2     | Technical deep dive    | [SE + IT]  | Complete
Week 2     | Stakeholder intro      | [Champion] | Complete
Week 3-4   | POC kickoff            | [SE]       | In Progress
Week 4     | POC success review     | [Both]     | Pending
Week 5     | Business case review   | [Champion] | Pending
Week 5     | Pricing proposal       | [AE]       | Pending
Week 6     | Executive presentation | [Both]     | Pending
Week 6     | MSA review begins      | [Legal]    | Pending
Week 7     | Contract redlines      | [Legal]    | Pending
Week 8     | Signature              | [EB]       | Target Close

RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

Risk: CFO travel during Week 6
Mitigation: Scheduled async briefing, Champion to present

Risk: Procurement review could extend timeline
Mitigation: Engaged procurement in Week 4

OPEN QUESTIONS

- Final seat count for pricing (due Week 4)
- Security questionnaire status (due Week 5)

### Good Velocity Optimization

```
Velocity Improvement Case Study:

Problem: Average cycle 75 days, target 55 days

Analysis:
├── Discovery → Qualified: 12 days (target 7)
│   └── Cause: Reps not booking immediately
├── Qualified → Evaluation: 20 days (target 14)
│   └── Cause: Waiting for prospect to set up POC
├── Evaluation → Proposal: 25 days (target 20)
│   └── Cause: POC scope creep, no time limit
└── Proposal → Close: 18 days (target 14)
    └── Cause: Legal surprised by redlines

Actions:
1. Implemented "book next meeting" requirement in CRM
2. Created standard POC environment (no setup required)
3. POC time-boxed to 14 days, success criteria required
4. MSA sent at proposal stage, standard redlines shared

Results (After 1 Quarter):
├── Discovery → Qualified: 12 → 8 days
├── Qualified → Evaluation: 20 → 12 days
├── Evaluation → Proposal: 25 → 18 days
└── Proposal → Close: 18 → 13 days

New Average: 51 days (32% improvement)
```

### Bad Velocity Practices

```
Artificial Velocity (Anti-Pattern):

Sales Leader: "Our cycle time is too long. I want it cut by 30%."

Action: Reps start pushing prospects to make decisions
- "We need a decision by Friday"
- "This pricing expires Monday"
- Pressure tactics, manufactured urgency

Result:
- Prospects feel rushed, deals die
- Win rate drops from 25% to 18%
- Cycle shortens but revenue decreases
- Customer relationships damaged
```

```
Ignoring Reality (Anti-Pattern):

Deal has been in "Evaluation" for 45 days
Rep: "They're just busy, it'll close next week"
Manager: "Update the close date and move on"

Problem:
- Close date updated 4 times
- No actual buyer activity
- Deal eventually lost to "no decision"
- Should have been disqualified or re-engaged
```

### Velocity Killers

| Killer | Symptoms | Fix |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **Single-threaded** | Champion goes dark = deal dies | Multi-thread from Day 1 |
| **Scope creep** | POC keeps expanding | Written success criteria |
| **Procurement surprise** | 3-week delay at the end | Engage procurement early |
| **Ghosting after proposal** | No response post-proposal | Pre-schedule review call |
| **Legal redlines** | Standard terms challenged | Pre-share MSA early |
| **Internal alignment** | Stakeholders misaligned | Stakeholder mapping early |
| **Budget not secured** | "Waiting on budget approval" | Confirm budget at qualification |

### Velocity vs. Quality Trade-offs

**Balance Speed and Win Rate:**

```
Scenario Analysis:

Current State:
- Cycle: 60 days
- Win Rate: 25%
- 100 opportunities
- Velocity: $20,833/day

Option A: Push harder (faster, lower win rate)
- Cycle: 45 days
- Win Rate: 20% (pressure reduces conversion)
- Velocity: $22,222/day (+7%)

Option B: Better process (faster AND better win rate)
- Cycle: 50 days
- Win Rate: 28% (better qualification)
- Velocity: $28,000/day (+34%)

Lesson: Don't sacrifice quality for speed
```

Deals in Stage >2x Average:
├── Acme Corp: 45 days in Evaluation (normal: 20)
├── TechFlow: 30 days in Qualified (normal: 14)
└── DataCo: 35 days in Proposal (normal: 10)

Actions:
- Acme Corp: Schedule checkpoint call, decision needed
- TechFlow: Champion check, may need new contact
- DataCo: Pricing concern? Re-engage on value
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Vanity dates** — Close dates that never come
- **Pressure over process** — Pushing vs. enabling
- **Ignoring stalls** — "They're just slow"
- **One-size timeline** — Same cycle expectation for all deals
- **Speed without quality** — Fast losses are still losses
- **No stage analysis** — Only looking at total cycle
- **Blame the buyer** — "They take forever" (what can YOU do?)
