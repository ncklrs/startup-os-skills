## Sales Qualification Frameworks

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Qualification determines where your reps spend their time. The right framework surfaces deal-killers early and focuses effort on winnable opportunities.

### Framework Selection Matrix

| Framework | Complexity | Best For | When to Use |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| **MEDDIC** | High | Enterprise $100K+ | Complex, multi-stakeholder |
| **MEDDPICC** | Very High | Strategic $500K+ | Highly competitive deals |
| **BANT** | Low | SMB, transactional | High volume, quick cycles |
| **SPICED** | Medium | Consultative sales | Discovery-heavy processes |
| **CHAMP** | Medium | SaaS, modern sales | Challenge-led selling |
| **SCOTSMAN** | Medium | Mid-market | Scoring/prioritization |

### MEDDIC Deep Dive

The gold standard for enterprise sales qualification.

| Letter | Element | Key Questions | Red Flags |
|--------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **M** | Metrics | What business outcomes will you measure? What's the cost of inaction? | "We're not sure yet" |
| **E** | Economic Buyer | Who signs the check? Who can kill the deal? | Can't identify, never met them |
| **D** | Decision Criteria | What factors determine your choice? | "We'll evaluate everything" |
| **D** | Decision Process | Walk me through approval. Who's involved? | No clear process, vague timeline |
| **I** | Identify Pain | What happens if you don't solve this? | "Nice to have" not "must have" |
| **C** | Champion | Who's advocating internally? Will they coach us? | No internal advocate |

#### MEDDIC Scoring Template

```
Score each 1-5 (1=none, 5=fully validated)

M - Metrics:           [ ] Quantified business impact documented
E - Economic Buyer:    [ ] Identified and engaged
D - Decision Criteria: [ ] Written criteria aligned to our strengths
D - Decision Process:  [ ] Timeline and stakeholders mapped
I - Identified Pain:   [ ] Compelling event driving urgency
C - Champion:          [ ] Active advocate providing intel

Total: __/30

< 15: Early stage, needs work
15-22: Developing, gaps to address
23-30: Strong opportunity, accelerate
```

### BANT for Transactional Sales

Simple, fast, effective for high-volume sales.

| Element | Question | Qualification Threshold |
|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **Budget** | What have you allocated for this? | Within your price range |
| **Authority** | Are you the decision-maker? | Yes, or clear path to DM |
| **Need** | What problem are you solving? | Real pain, not curiosity |
| **Timeline** | When do you need to decide? | Within your sales cycle |

### SPICED for Discovery

Modern framework emphasizing business impact.

```
S - Situation
   "Walk me through your current process."
   "How is your team structured?"
   "What tools are you using today?"

P - Pain
   "What's broken about that?"
   "What keeps you up at night?"
   "What would happen if nothing changed?"

I - Impact
   "How does that affect revenue/costs/risk?"
   "What's the cost of the status quo?"
   "How does leadership view this?"

C - Critical Event
   "Why now? What's driving the timeline?"
   "What happens if you miss that date?"
   "What's at stake?"

E - Decision
   "How will you evaluate solutions?"
   "Who needs to be involved?"
   "What does success look like?"

D - Decision Process
   "Walk me through how you've made similar decisions."
   "What are the approval steps?"
   "What could slow this down?"
```

### Good Qualification Examples

```
Strong MEDDIC Response:
AE: "Who will ultimately approve this purchase?"
Prospect: "Sarah Chen, our CFO. She approved our last platform
purchase. I've already briefed her and she's supportive. She'll
want to see ROI projections before the exec meeting on the 15th."

Why it's good:
✓ Named economic buyer
✓ Confirmed prior relationship
✓ Champion has already engaged EB
✓ Clear timeline and process
✓ Specific requirement (ROI projections)
```

```
Strong Pain Identification:
AE: "What happens if you don't solve this problem?"
Prospect: "We'll miss our Q3 launch deadline, which means
$2M in delayed revenue. My VP has this as his #1 priority,
and I've been tasked to find a solution by end of month."

Why it's good:
✓ Quantified impact ($2M)
✓ Executive visibility (VP priority)
✓ Compelling event (Q3 deadline)
✓ Clear timeline (end of month)
```

### Bad Qualification Examples

```
Weak MEDDIC Response:
AE: "Who makes the final decision?"
Prospect: "I think it goes to leadership at some point."

Why it's bad:
✗ No named individual
✗ Vague process ("at some point")
✗ Prospect doesn't understand their own buying process
✗ Warning sign: prospect may not have organizational support
```

```
False Champion Warning:
Prospect: "I love your product! This is exactly what we need.
I'm going to push hard for this."

Reality check: Enthusiasm ≠ influence. Ask:
- "Have you successfully sponsored purchases before?"
- "Who else needs to be convinced?"
- "What obstacles do you anticipate?"
```

### Qualification Red Flags

| Signal | What It Means | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| "We're just researching" | No compelling event | Find the trigger or nurture |
| "I'll take it to my boss" | Not the champion | Multi-thread immediately |
| "Budget isn't set yet" | Low priority project | Quantify pain to justify budget |
| "We're evaluating everyone" | Column fodder | Differentiate or walk away |
| "Timeline is flexible" | No urgency | Create or find compelling event |
| Can't articulate the problem | Tire kicker | Discovery or disqualify |

### Disqualification Discipline

Know when to walk away. Time spent on bad deals is time stolen from good ones.

**Disqualify when:**
- No budget AND no path to budget
- No authority AND no access to authority
- No pain or pain is "nice to have"
- Timeline is beyond your sales cycle
- Deal requires you to be something you're not
- Prospect is using you for leverage with incumbent

**How to disqualify gracefully:**
```
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like the timing might
not be right for this. I'd rather be honest than waste your time.
Would it make sense to reconnect in [timeframe] when [trigger]?"
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Checkbox qualification** — Going through motions without listening
- **Single-meeting qualification** — Expecting all answers in one call
- **Accepting "yes" at face value** — Not verifying claims
- **Skipping pain for features** — Demoing before qualifying
- **Champion confusion** — Mistaking enthusiasm for influence
- **Sunk cost fallacy** — Pursuing dead deals because of time invested
