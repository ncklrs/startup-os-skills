## Territory and Account Planning

**Impact: HIGH**

Territory design determines rep productivity. Poor territories create conflict, missed opportunities, and burned-out reps. Great territories balance opportunity, workload, and growth potential.

### Territory Design Principles

1. **Equal opportunity** — Not equal size, equal revenue potential
2. **Clear boundaries** — No ambiguity about ownership
3. **Appropriate coverage** — Workload matches capacity
4. **Growth headroom** — Room to expand without restructuring
5. **Stability** — Changes only when necessary

### Territory Segmentation Models

| Model | How It Works | Best For | Risks |
|-------|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Geographic** | By region/country | Field sales, local relationships | Uneven opportunity density |
| **Named Accounts** | Specific accounts assigned | Enterprise, strategic | Conflict on new logos |
| **Industry Vertical** | By sector | Domain expertise matters | Cross-industry companies |
| **Company Size** | By employee count or revenue | Tiered sales motions | Companies that grow |
| **Round Robin** | Sequential assignment | SMB, high volume | Inconsistent rep quality |
| **Hybrid** | Combination of above | Most B2B SaaS | Complexity |

### Territory Sizing Framework

**Target Capacity Calculation:**

```
Step 1: Calculate Total Addressable Territory
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Total Accounts in ICP: 10,000                               │
│ Average Deal Size: $50,000                                  │
│ Addressable TAM: $500M                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 2: Define Coverage Model
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Annual Quota per Rep: $1M                                   │
│ Win Rate: 25%                                               │
│ Required Pipeline: $4M per rep                              │
│ Average Opportunities per Account: 1                        │
│ Accounts Needed per Rep: 160 (at 4M / 50K * 25%)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 3: Determine Territory Size
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Minimum viable territory: 200 accounts                      │
│ (Buffer for disqualification, timing, churn)                │
│                                                             │
│ Maximum manageable: 500 accounts                            │
│ (Beyond this, coverage drops)                               │
│                                                             │
│ Sweet spot: 250-350 accounts per enterprise rep             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Account Capacity by Role:**

| Role | Account Capacity | Why |
|------|-----------------|-----|
| Strategic AE | 10-25 named | Deep engagement required |
| Enterprise AE | 50-150 | Complex sales, multi-threading |
| Mid-Market AE | 150-300 | Balanced engagement |
| SMB AE | 300-500+ | Transactional velocity |
| SDR | 500-1000 | Outbound coverage |

### Account Tiering

**The ABM Tier Model:**

| Tier | Definition | Coverage Model | Marketing Support |
|------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Tier 1** | 10-25 strategic accounts | 1:1 personalized | Custom campaigns, exec alignment |
| **Tier 2** | 50-100 high-value | 1:Few cluster | Industry-specific, high-touch |
| **Tier 3** | 200-500 growth targets | 1:Many programmatic | Automated, scaled campaigns |
| **Tier 4** | All remaining ICP | Self-serve + support | Broad digital marketing |

**Account Scoring Criteria:**

| Factor | Weight | Scoring |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Company Size (employees) | 20% | 1-5 based on fit |
| Industry | 15% | 1-5 based on fit |
| Technology Stack | 15% | 1-5 based on fit |
| Engagement History | 20% | 1-5 based on activity |
| Buying Signals | 20% | 1-5 based on intent |
| Competitive Presence | 10% | 1-5 (lower if incumbent) |

### Good Territory Design

```
Balanced Enterprise Territory:

Territory: US West - Enterprise Technology
Rep: Sarah Chen
Quota: $1.5M

Account Composition:
├── Tier 1 (Named): 15 accounts
│   └── Combined TAM: $8M
│   └── Expected from named: $750K
├── Tier 2 (Target): 100 accounts
│   └── Combined TAM: $25M
│   └── Expected: $500K
└── Tier 3 (Develop): 200 accounts
    └── Combined TAM: $30M
    └── Expected: $250K

Total Pipeline Potential: $63M
Expected Revenue: $1.5M (2.4% capture rate)
Pipeline Coverage: 4.2x quota (at 25% win rate)

Why it works:
✓ Mix of named and territory accounts
✓ Clear tiering with different strategies
✓ Achievable quota with realistic win rates
✓ Headroom for overachievement
```

### Bad Territory Design

```
Problematic Territory Assignment:

Territory: "Enterprise - All Verticals"
Rep: New hire (6 months experience)
Quota: $2M
Accounts: 400 (no tiering)

Problems:
✗ Too many accounts for enterprise coverage
✗ No prioritization guidance
✗ New rep without domain expertise
✗ No named accounts for focus
✗ Quota likely unachievable
✗ Rep will spray and pray
```

```
Overlapping Territories:

SDR Team: Outbound to all accounts
AE Team: Inbound from all accounts
Partner Team: Partner-sourced to all accounts

Result:
- Same account gets 3 different outreaches
- Customer confusion and annoyance
- Internal conflict over attribution
- "Who owns this account?" debates
```

### Territory Conflict Resolution

**Clear Rules of Engagement:**

| Scenario | Rule |
|----------|------|
| New inbound lead | Assign to territory owner based on geography/segment |
| Existing customer | Owner is current AE regardless of where lead came from |
| Cross-territory referral | Meeting jointly, credit to generator, ownership stays |
| Account moves segments | Transition plan with overlap period |
| Strategic override | VP+ approval required, documented |

### Annual Territory Planning Process

```
Q4 Planning Timeline:

Week 1-2: Data Preparation
├── Clean account data
├── Update account scoring
├── Analyze current territory performance
└── Identify account changes (M&A, growth, churn)

Week 3-4: Territory Modeling
├── Model 2-3 territory designs
├── Calculate coverage and quota alignment
├── Identify conflicts and overlaps
└── Pressure test with edge cases

Week 5-6: Stakeholder Review
├── Review with Sales Leadership
├── Gather rep feedback (informally)
├── Align with Marketing on ABM tiers
└── Finalize design

Week 7-8: Communication and Rollout
├── Communicate changes individually first
├── Provide transition guidance
├── Update systems (CRM, routing)
└── Document rules of engagement
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Annual chaos** — Major territory changes every year
- **Carving up success** — Taking accounts from top performers
- **Ignoring workload** — Equal accounts ≠ equal opportunity
- **No transition period** — Abrupt changes mid-deal
- **Gaming the system** — Reps hoarding accounts they won't work
- **Spreadsheet territories** — No CRM enforcement
