## Sales Methodology Selection

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Your sales methodology is how you sell — the philosophy and tactics that guide every customer interaction. Choose based on your buyer, product complexity, and competitive landscape.

### Methodology Comparison

| Methodology | Core Principle | Best For | Requires |
|-------------|----------------|----------|----------|
| **Challenger** | Teach, tailor, take control | Complex B2B, commoditized markets | Deep industry insight |
| **Solution Selling** | Diagnose before prescribe | Technical products, customization | Discovery excellence |
| **SPIN Selling** | Questions reveal need | Consultative, long cycles | Patient, skilled reps |
| **Sandler** | Buyer qualifies themselves | Transactional, many competitors | Strong disqualification |
| **Value Selling** | Quantified business impact | ROI-driven buyers, enterprise | Financial acumen |
| **Command of Message** | Differentiated value | Competitive markets | Clear value framework |

### The Challenger Sale

Ideal for markets where buyers think they know what they need (but don't).

**The Three T's:**

```
TEACH
└── Deliver insights they haven't heard
    └── Challenge their assumptions
        └── Reframe their world

TAILOR
└── Connect insights to their specific context
    └── Speak to different stakeholders differently
        └── Make it about THEIR business

TAKE CONTROL
└── Push back on unreasonable requests
    └── Drive momentum when they stall
        └── Don't be afraid of productive tension
```

**Challenger Rep Profile:**
- Offers unique perspectives
- Strong two-way communication
- Knows customer's value drivers
- Comfortable discussing money
- Can push the customer

**Challenger Commercial Teaching:**
```
1. The Warmer: Connect to known issue
   "Most teams like yours struggle with..."

2. The Reframe: Challenge their thinking
   "But the real problem isn't what you think..."

3. Rational Drowning: Data to support new frame
   "Here's what the research shows..."

4. Emotional Impact: Make it personal
   "Think about what this means for your team..."

5. The New Way: Present your solution
   "There's a better approach..."

6. Your Solution: How you enable the new way
   "This is where we help..."
```

### SPIN Selling

Question-based methodology for complex sales.

| Question Type | Purpose | Example |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Situation** | Gather facts | "How many reps do you have?" |
| **Problem** | Uncover difficulties | "Where do deals get stuck?" |
| **Implication** | Develop urgency | "What does that cost you in lost revenue?" |
| **Need-Payoff** | Build value | "How would 20% faster cycles affect your targets?" |

**SPIN Sequence:**
```
Situation (2-3 questions max)
    ↓
Problem (identify pain)
    ↓
Implication (amplify pain)
    ↓
Need-Payoff (envision solution)
    ↓
Capability Discussion (your solution)
```

### Solution Selling

Diagnostic approach: understand before prescribing.

**Solution Selling Process:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. DIAGNOSE                                                 │
│    - Current state analysis                                 │
│    - Pain identification                                    │
│    - Impact quantification                                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. DESIGN                                                   │
│    - Future state vision                                    │
│    - Solution requirements                                  │
│    - Success criteria                                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. DELIVER                                                  │
│    - Proposed solution                                      │
│    - Implementation plan                                    │
│    - ROI projection                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Value Selling Framework

For buyers who demand ROI justification.

**Value Equation:**
```
                (Benefits - Costs)
Value =  ─────────────────────────────
               Risk × Time
```

**Building the Business Case:**

| Component | What to Include | Source |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Current State Costs | Labor, tools, inefficiency | Discovery |
| Future State Benefits | Savings, revenue, productivity | Industry benchmarks |
| Solution Costs | License, implementation, ongoing | Your pricing |
| Risk Factors | Change management, integration | Honest assessment |
| Timeline | Time-to-value, full rollout | Realistic projection |

### Good Methodology Application

```
Challenger Teaching Example:

AE: "Most revenue leaders I talk to are focused on hiring
more reps to hit their number. But here's what our data
shows: the top 10% of companies we work with increased
revenue 35% with the SAME headcount.

The difference? They fixed their win rate first. One VP of
Sales I spoke with said, 'We were pouring water into a
leaky bucket.' They had a 15% win rate - industry average
is 25%. By improving qualification and deal execution,
they got to 28%.

What's your current win rate, and how does that compare
to where you want to be?"

Why it works:
✓ Challenges conventional thinking (hiring vs. win rate)
✓ Uses data to reframe
✓ Social proof (VP quote)
✓ Ties back to their situation
✓ Opens discovery naturally
```

```
SPIN Application Example:

Situation: "How are you tracking sales activities today?"
Answer: "We use spreadsheets and Salesforce."

Problem: "What challenges do you face with that approach?"
Answer: "Reps hate logging activities, so data is unreliable."

Implication: "When you have unreliable data, how does that
affect your forecasting accuracy?"
Answer: "We miss our forecast by 20%+ every quarter."

Need-Payoff: "If you could automatically capture activities
and improve forecast accuracy to within 5%, what would that
mean for your planning and resource allocation?"
Answer: "That would be game-changing for how we invest."
```

### Bad Methodology Application

```
Demo-First Selling (Anti-Pattern):

AE: "Thanks for taking the call. Let me share my screen
and show you our platform. So this is the dashboard,
you can see all your metrics here. And this is the
workflow builder. Pretty cool, right? Any questions?"

Prospect: "How much does it cost?"

Why it fails:
✗ No discovery of pain
✗ No qualification
✗ Features without context
✗ Commodity positioning (price is only differentiator)
✗ No value established
```

```
False Challenger (Lecturing, Not Teaching):

AE: "Let me tell you why everything you're doing is wrong.
Your process is outdated, your tools are terrible, and
frankly, your team doesn't know what they're doing."

Why it fails:
✗ Insulting, not insightful
✗ No data to support claims
✗ Not tailored to their context
✗ Breaks relationship, not builds it
✗ Challenger teaches; this just criticizes
```

### Matching Methodology to Context

| Buyer Type | Recommended Approach | Why |
|-----------|---------------------|-----|
| **Technical evaluator** | Solution Selling | Wants diagnosis and depth |
| **Executive sponsor** | Challenger/Value | Wants insights and ROI |
| **Procurement** | Value Selling | Needs justification |
| **Champion (internal)** | Consultative | Wants to look good |
| **Skeptic** | SPIN | Let them discover the pain |
| **Status quo defender** | Challenger | Must reframe their thinking |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Methodology tourism** — Switching approaches mid-deal
- **One-size-fits-all** — Same pitch regardless of audience
- **Methodology as religion** — Rigid adherence despite context
- **Teaching without earning** — Challenging before building rapport
- **Question interrogation** — SPIN without conversation
- **Value without validation** — ROI projections with no basis
