## Quota Setting and Capacity Planning

**Impact: HIGH**

Quota setting is where strategy meets reality. Set quotas too high and you demoralize reps and increase attrition. Set them too low and you leave money on the table. Capacity planning ensures you have the right people in the right roles to hit your number.

### Quota Setting Principles

1. **Achievable by most** — 60-70% of reps should hit quota
2. **Based on data** — Historical performance, market potential, not wishes
3. **Aligned with OTE** — Quota should be 4-5x OTE for most roles
4. **Account for ramp** — New reps get reduced quotas
5. **Fair and transparent** — Reps understand how quota was set

### Quota-to-OTE Ratios

| Role | OTE | Quota Multiplier | Quota |
|------|-----|------------------|-------|
| SDR | $80K | N/A (activity-based) | Meetings/month |
| SMB AE | $120K | 5x | $600K |
| MM AE | $180K | 4.5x | $810K |
| Enterprise AE | $280K | 4x | $1.12M |
| Strategic AE | $400K | 3.5x | $1.4M |

### Quota Setting Methods

**Method 1: Top-Down**
```
Company Target: $50M ARR
├── Less: Existing renewal base: $30M
├── Net New Target: $20M
├── Sales Team Contribution: 80% = $16M
│   (Marketing/other sources: 20%)
├── Number of Reps: 20
└── Average Quota: $800K per rep

Adjustment: Add 10-15% buffer for attrition and misses
Loaded Target: $18.4M ($920K average)
```

**Method 2: Bottom-Up**
```
Individual Rep Calculation:

Historical Performance:
├── Rep's trailing 4 quarters: $680K, $720K, $750K, $780K
├── Average: $732K
├── Growth Assumption: 10%
└── Calculated Quota: $805K

Territory Potential:
├── Addressable accounts: 200
├── Average deal size: $40K
├── Realistic capture rate: 5%
└── Territory ceiling: $400K
    (Conflict: Territory can't support quota)

Adjustment Required: Add accounts or reduce quota
```

**Method 3: Market-Based**
```
Market Potential Analysis:

Territory TAM: $50M
├── Realistic SAM (qualified): $25M
├── Target Market Share: 5%
└── Territory Potential: $1.25M

Rep Capacity:
├── Working days/quarter: 65
├── Selling time: 60% = 39 days
├── Deals manageable: 15-20
├── Average deal: $50K
└── Capacity ceiling: $750K-$1M

Quota: Set at $800K (within capacity and potential)
```

### Ramp Schedule

**Standard Ramp Model:**

| Month | Quota % | Rationale |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | 0% | Training, onboarding |
| 2 | 0% | Shadowing, certification |
| 3 | 25% | Building pipeline |
| 4 | 50% | First closes expected |
| 5 | 75% | Maturing |
| 6 | 100% | Fully ramped |

**By Segment:**

| Segment | Ramp Period | Time to Full Productivity |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| SMB | 3 months | 4-5 months |
| Mid-Market | 4-5 months | 6-8 months |
| Enterprise | 6-9 months | 9-12 months |
| Strategic | 9-12 months | 12-18 months |

### Capacity Planning Model

**Annual Capacity Planning:**

```
CAPACITY CALCULATION

Step 1: Revenue Target
├── Next Year Target: $100M
├── Existing Renewals: $60M (85% retention)
│   = $51M from base
└── Net New Required: $49M

Step 2: Rep Productivity
├── Ramped Rep Average: $1M
├── New Rep Average: $500K (ramp adjusted)
└── Blended productivity: $850K

Step 3: Headcount Requirement
├── Reps Needed: $49M / $850K = 58 reps
├── Current Reps: 40
├── Attrition (20%): -8 reps
├── Ending without hiring: 32 reps
└── Hiring Needed: 26 reps

Step 4: Hiring Timeline
├── Q1 Hires: 8 reps (productive by Q3)
├── Q2 Hires: 10 reps (productive by Q4)
├── Q3 Hires: 8 reps (productive next year)
└── Total: 26 reps
```

**Role Ratio Planning:**

```
Sales Org Ratios (Benchmarks)

SDR : AE Ratio
├── SMB: 1:3 (one SDR feeds 3 AEs)
├── Mid-Market: 1:2
├── Enterprise: 1:1 or 2:1
└── Strategic: Dedicated SDR per AE

AE : SE Ratio
├── Simple product: 1:0 (no SE)
├── Technical sale: 2:1 or 3:1
├── Complex sale: 1:1

AE : CSM Ratio
├── High-touch: 1:1
├── Mid-touch: 1:2 or 1:3
├── Tech-touch: 1:10+

Manager : Rep Ratio
├── SDR Manager: 1:8-10
├── AE Manager: 1:6-8
├── Enterprise Manager: 1:5-6
```

### Good Quota Setting

```
Quota Setting Process:

1. Historical Analysis
   Rep trailing 12 months: $920K
   YoY growth in territory: 15%
   Market growth: 12%
   Historical attainment: 85% (she exceeded)

2. Territory Analysis
   New accounts added: 20 high-potential
   Accounts removed: 10 (low potential)
   Net TAM change: +$5M

3. Capacity Analysis
   Tenure: 3 years (fully ramped)
   Performance trend: Improving
   No major life changes planned

4. Quota Calculation
   Base (historical + growth): $920K × 1.15 = $1.058M
   Territory adjustment: +$50K potential
   Final quota: $1.1M

5. Rep Communication
   "Your quota is $1.1M based on your $920K last year,
   15% growth assumption, and the 20 new accounts we
   added. At 100%, your OTE is $280K. Here's the math..."

Why it works:
✓ Data-driven, not arbitrary
✓ Considers territory changes
✓ Transparent methodology
✓ Rep understands the logic
```

### Bad Quota Setting

```
Bad Quota Assignment:

Board target: "We need to grow 50%"
Last year revenue: $50M
This year target: $75M
Same headcount: 50 reps

Old average quota: $1M
New average quota: $1.5M (50% increase)

Communication: "Your quota is $1.5M this year."
Rep: "How was that determined?"
Manager: "Company needs to grow 50%."

Problems:
✗ No individual analysis
✗ No territory capacity check
✗ Same territory, higher quota = impossible
✗ Zero rationale beyond company target
✗ Will cause attrition and sandbagging
```

### Quota Relief Policies

**When to Adjust Mid-Year:**

| Situation | Policy |
|-----------|--------|
| Territory change | Pro-rate quota for new territory |
| Major account loss (not rep's fault) | Adjust by lost ARR |
| Extended leave (>4 weeks) | Pro-rate for time out |
| Product issues | Case-by-case, documented |
| Economic shock | Company-wide adjustment |

**What NOT to Adjust For:**

- Rep's deal slipped (normal sales volatility)
- Competitor won a deal (should have been qualified out)
- "I didn't know" (training/enablement issue)
- Champion left (multi-threading is rep responsibility)

### Capacity Planning Scenarios

```
Scenario Modeling:

Base Case: $100M target
├── Attrition: 20%
├── Ramp time: 6 months
├── Hiring: 26 reps
├── Year-end headcount: 58
└── Risk: Medium

Aggressive Case: $120M target
├── Attrition: 15% (retention investment)
├── Ramp time: 5 months (better enablement)
├── Hiring: 35 reps
├── Year-end headcount: 68
└── Risk: High (hiring risk)

Conservative Case: $85M target
├── Attrition: 25% (economic uncertainty)
├── Ramp time: 7 months
├── Hiring: 15 reps
├── Year-end headcount: 47
└── Risk: Low (but misses board target)
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Peanut butter quotas** — Same quota for all, regardless of territory
- **Punishment quotas** — Raising quota because rep overachieved
- **Lottery quotas** — Based on luck of territory assignment
- **Unattainable stretch** — Less than 50% of reps can hit
- **Mid-year surprises** — Changing quota without warning
- **Ignoring ramp** — Full quota on day one
- **Capacity denial** — "We'll figure out headcount later"
