## Continuous Learning Programs

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Onboarding gets you started. Continuous learning keeps you sharp. Top-performing sales teams invest in ongoing development, not just new hire training.

| **Interactive** | Quiz or activity | Scenario with choices |

### Microlearning Example

```markdown
## Daily Discovery Tip #47

### The "Help Me Understand" Technique

⏱️ 4 minutes

**Situation:**
Prospect gives a vague answer to your question.

**Technique:**
Instead of moving on or making assumptions, use:
"Help me understand..."

**Example:**
❌ Prospect: "We're not happy with our current solution."
❌ You: "Got it. So what features are you looking for?"

✅ Prospect: "We're not happy with our current solution."
✅ You: "Help me understand what's not working for you specifically?"

**Why it works:**
- Non-threatening way to probe deeper
- Shows genuine curiosity
- Avoids assumptions
- Gets to real pain

**Your Challenge:**
Use "Help me understand" at least 3 times on your next discovery call. Note what you learned.

---
📝 Quick Quiz:
When should you NOT use this technique?
A) When pressed for time
B) When the answer was already specific
C) When talking to technical buyers
D) When the deal is early stage

[Answer: B - If they gave specific detail, go deeper on that instead]

- **Passive consumption** — No application or practice
- **Manager non-participation** — Leaders don't model learning
- **Learning as punishment** — Only underperformers get "trained"
- **No time allocated** — "Learn on your own time"
- **Content dump** — 500 resources with no curation
- **Forgetting the forgetting curve** — Train once, assume retention
