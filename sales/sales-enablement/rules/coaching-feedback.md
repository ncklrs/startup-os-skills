## Coaching and Feedback Programs

**Impact: HIGH**

Managers who spend 3+ hours per week coaching see 17% higher quota attainment on their teams. Coaching is the highest-leverage activity for sales managers.

### Coaching vs. Training vs. Managing

| Activity | Focus | Frequency | Owner |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Training** | Knowledge transfer | Periodic | Enablement |
| **Coaching** | Skill development | Continuous | Manager |
| **Managing** | Performance accountability | Ongoing | Manager |

```
TRAINING answers: "What should I do?"
COACHING answers: "How can I do it better?"
MANAGING answers: "Are you doing it?"
```

### The Coaching Equation

```
Rep Performance =
    Skill × Will × Environment

Where:
- Skill = Coaching develops
- Will = Motivation (manager inspires)
- Environment = Tools, territory, comp (org provides)

Coaching can't fix:
- Poor product-market fit
- Bad territory
- Wrong comp plan
- Cultural issues
```

### The GROW Coaching Model

| Stage | Purpose | Sample Questions |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **Goal** | Define what success looks like | "What do you want to achieve in this deal?" "What would a great outcome look like?" |
| **Reality** | Assess current situation | "Where are you now?" "What's working? What's not?" "What have you tried?" |
| **Options** | Explore possibilities | "What could you do?" "What else?" "What would [top performer] do?" |
| **Will** | Commit to action | "What will you do?" "When?" "What support do you need?" |

### Good Coaching Conversation

```markdown
## Deal Coaching Session: Acme Corp Opportunity

CONTEXT:
Rep: Sarah (Mid-market AE, 8 months tenure)
Deal: $85K, Evaluation stage, stalled 3 weeks
Time: 30 minutes

---

MANAGER: "Let's talk about Acme. What's your goal for this conversation?"

REP: "I need to figure out why this deal stalled and how to move it forward."

MANAGER: "Good. Walk me through where things stand right now."

REP: "We did a great demo 3 weeks ago. They said they loved it. But now the
champion isn't responding to my emails."

MANAGER: "What do you think changed?"

REP: "I'm not sure. Maybe they got busy? Or maybe there's competition?"

MANAGER: "What have you tried to re-engage them?"

REP: "I've sent 3 follow-up emails and tried calling twice."

MANAGER: "All to the same person—your champion. Who else have you built
relationships with there?"

REP: "Just Lisa, my champion."

MANAGER: "What are some other ways you could learn what's happening?"

REP: "I could... reach out to the technical lead who was in the demo? Or maybe
connect with Lisa on LinkedIn to try a different channel?"

MANAGER: "Those are good. What else?"

REP: "I could try going above her to the VP? Or... actually, maybe I should
check if there's a connection in our network who knows someone there."

MANAGER: "I like the network idea. What will you commit to doing this week?"

REP: "I'll reach out to the technical lead tomorrow with a relevant technical
resource. And I'll check LinkedIn for mutual connections with the VP."

MANAGER: "Perfect. When can we debrief on what you learn?"

REP: "How about Thursday in our 1:1?"

MANAGER: "Let's do it. I'm confident you'll crack this open."
```

### Bad Coaching Conversation

```markdown
## Deal Coaching Session (What NOT to Do)

MANAGER: "Your Acme deal is stuck. You need to call the VP directly."

REP: "But I don't have a relationship with—"

MANAGER: "That's the problem. You should have multi-threaded from the start.
I would have already sent a package to their office and set up a dinner."

REP: "Okay, I'll try the VP..."

MANAGER: "Also, your email follow-ups are too long. Keep them to 2 sentences.
And don't use the word 'just' — it sounds weak. Here, let me draft the email
for you..."

---

PROBLEMS:
✗ Telling, not asking
✗ Manager did the thinking
✗ Rep didn't own the solution
✗ No commitment from rep
✗ Manager showing off instead of developing
✗ Rep leaves without confidence or ownership
```

### Call Review Framework

| Element | What to Observe | Coaching Focus |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Opening** | Rapport, agenda setting | First impressions |
| **Discovery** | Question quality, active listening | Understanding needs |
| **Positioning** | Value articulation, relevance | Connecting to pain |
| **Objections** | Handling technique, composure | Confidence and skill |
| **Close** | Next steps, commitment | Advancing deals |

### Good Call Review

```markdown
## Call Review: Discovery with Prospect X

SETUP:
- "I want to review your discovery call from yesterday."
- "What did you think went well?"
- "What would you do differently?"

OBSERVATION (Be specific):
"I noticed at 12:45 when they mentioned compliance concerns, you moved on
pretty quickly. Let's listen to that part again."

[Play clip]

INQUIRY:
"What do you think they were really worried about?"
"What could you have asked to go deeper there?"

MODELING:
"Here's how I might have approached that: 'That's interesting — tell me more
about your compliance situation. What specific requirements are you dealing
with?'"

PRACTICE:
"Let's role-play that. I'll be the prospect. Go ahead and respond to what
I said in the recording."

COMMIT:
"In your next discovery call, I want you to focus on going one question
deeper whenever a prospect mentions a pain point. Let's review that call
next week."
```

### Coaching Cadence by Performance Level

| Rep Level | Coaching Time | Focus |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **New (0-6 mo)** | 4+ hrs/week | Fundamentals, confidence building |
| **Developing (6-12 mo)** | 2-3 hrs/week | Skill refinement, deal coaching |
| **Performing** | 1-2 hrs/week | Advanced skills, stretch goals |
| **Star Performer** | 30-60 min/week | Career development, retention |
| **Struggling** | 3+ hrs/week | PIP, basic skills, intensive support |

### Feedback Best Practices

**The SBI Model:**
- **Situation:** "In your demo yesterday with Acme..."
- **Behavior:** "...when the prospect asked about pricing, you immediately went to a discount..."
- **Impact:** "...that made us look desperate and reduced our negotiating leverage."

**Feedback Timing:**
- Praise: Public and immediate
- Constructive: Private and timely
- Never: In front of customers or peers (if negative)

**The Praise-to-Critique Ratio:**
- Research shows 5:1 positive-to-negative for high-performing teams
- Build trust through recognition before correction

### Coaching Metrics

| Metric | How to Measure | Benchmark |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Coaching Time** | Calendar analysis | 3+ hrs/rep/week |
| **1:1 Completion** | Meeting cadence | 95%+ held |
| **Rep Development** | Skill assessments | Improvement over time |
| **Ramp Impact** | Time to productivity | Better than baseline |
| **Team Performance** | Quota attainment | Above company average |
| **Rep Retention** | Turnover rate | Below company average |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Seagull management** — Fly in, criticize, fly out
- **Pipeline inquisition** — Interrogation, not coaching
- **Telling not asking** — Manager does all the thinking
- **No time for coaching** — "Too busy" (always a choice)
- **Only coaching struggling reps** — Top performers need development too
- **Feedback sandwich** — So formulaic it loses impact
- **Coaching to your style** — Forcing reps to sell your way
- **No follow-up** — Coaching without accountability
