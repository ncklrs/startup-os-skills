## Territory Design & Optimization

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Well-designed territories create fair opportunity, reduce conflict, and maximize coverage. Poor territories demotivate reps and leave revenue on the table.

### Territory Design Principles

### Territory Segmentation Options

| Segmentation | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|--------------|----------|------|------|
| **Geographic** | Field sales, local presence | Clear boundaries, travel efficiency | Unequal revenue distribution |
| **Named Account** | Enterprise, strategic accounts | Deep relationships | Difficult to balance |
| **Industry/Vertical** | Domain expertise needed | Specialized knowledge | May overlap geographically |
| **Company Size** | Different sales motions | Appropriate sales cycle | Less account continuity |
| **Product Line** | Complex product portfolio | Product expertise | Customer confusion |
| **Hybrid** | Most companies | Balanced approach | More complex to manage |

### Territory Sizing Framework

**Step 1: Calculate Total Addressable Coverage**

```
Total TAM Accounts: 10,000
Average Deal Size: $50,000
Historical Win Rate: 20%
Average Sales Cycle: 90 days

Revenue Potential = 10,000 × $50K × 20% = $100M
```

**Step 2: Determine Rep Capacity**

```
Working days per quarter: 65
Deals rep can manage simultaneously: 25
Touches per deal per week: 3
Available selling hours/day: 5

Active deals per rep = 25
Expected closes per quarter = 25 × 20% = 5 deals
Revenue per rep/quarter = 5 × $50K = $250K
Annual quota = $1M
```

**Step 3: Calculate Territory Size**

```
Total Revenue Potential: $100M
Revenue per rep: $1M (at quota)
Coverage ratio: 3x (need 3x pipeline)
Required reps: $100M ÷ ($1M × 3) = 33 reps

Accounts per territory: 10,000 ÷ 33 = ~300 accounts
```

### Territory Balance Scorecard

| Metric | Territory A | Territory B | Territory C | Variance |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Account Count | 285 | 312 | 298 | ±5% |
| TAM ($M) | $8.2 | $7.9 | $8.5 | ±4% |
| Active Opps | 22 | 25 | 20 | ±11% |
| Historical Win Rate | 23% | 21% | 25% | ±9% |
| Growth Potential | High | Medium | High | — |
| Travel Load | Low | Medium | Low | — |
| **Balance Score** | 92 | 88 | 94 | Target: >85 |

### Territory Assignment Matrix

```
                        Company Size
                   SMB    Mid-Market   Enterprise
                ┌────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
    Technology  │ Pool A │   Rep 1    │  Rep 7-8   │
                ├────────┼────────────┼────────────┤
Industry        │ Pool A │   Rep 2    │  Rep 9-10  │
    Healthcare  ├────────┼────────────┼────────────┤
                │ Pool B │   Rep 3    │  Rep 11    │
    Finance     ├────────┼────────────┼────────────┤
                │ Pool B │   Rep 4    │  Rep 12    │
    Other       ├────────┼────────────┼────────────┤
                │ Pool C │  Rep 5-6   │  Rep 13    │
                └────────┴────────────┴────────────┘
```

### Geographic Territory Example

**Good Design: Balanced Revenue Potential**

```
Western Region ($25M TAM)
├── Pacific Northwest (WA, OR) - Rep 1
│   └── $8M TAM, 450 accounts
├── Northern California - Rep 2
│   └── $9M TAM, 380 accounts
└── Southern California - Rep 3
    └── $8M TAM, 520 accounts
```

**Bad Design: Unbalanced**

```
Western Region ($25M TAM)
├── California - Rep 1
│   └── $17M TAM (unfair advantage!)
└── Everything Else (WA, OR, AZ, NV, etc.) - Rep 2
    └── $8M TAM (set up to fail)
```

### Territory Conflict Resolution

| Conflict Type | Resolution Rule | Example |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Account moves to new territory | Grace period (90 days), then transfer | Company relocates HQ |
| Subsidiary vs parent | Parent account owner wins | Regional office vs HQ |
| Contact changes companies | New territory owner | Champion joins new company |
| Industry reclassification | Revenue-based decision | Fintech: Finance or Tech? |
| Named account dispute | Manager arbitration | Strategic account overlap |

### Quota Allocation by Territory

```
Company Annual Target: $10M

Territory Quota Setting:
┌─────────────┬──────────┬────────────┬──────────┬───────────┐
│ Territory   │ TAM      │ % of Total │ Base     │ Adjusted  │
│             │          │            │ Quota    │ Quota     │
├─────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼──────────┼───────────┤
│ Enterprise  │ $20M     │ 40%        │ $4M      │ $3.8M*    │
│ Mid-Market  │ $15M     │ 30%        │ $3M      │ $3.2M     │
│ SMB         │ $10M     │ 20%        │ $2M      │ $2M       │
│ Growth      │ $5M      │ 10%        │ $1M      │ $1M       │
├─────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼──────────┼───────────┤
│ Total       │ $50M     │ 100%       │ $10M     │ $10M      │
└─────────────┴──────────┴────────────┴──────────┴───────────┘

*Enterprise adjusted down due to longer sales cycles
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Grandfather clauses forever** — Reps keep accounts from 5 years ago
- **Political territories** — Designed around people, not business
- **No documentation** — No one knows why territories are drawn this way
- **Annual-only reviews** — Market changes faster than territory updates
- **Ignoring travel** — Rep has accounts 8 time zones apart
- **Unbalanced quotas** — Same quota for vastly different territories
- **No conflict resolution** — Disputes handled ad-hoc
