# Proposal Writer

Strategic expertise for crafting winning sales proposals, pricing presentations, and RFP responses that close deals.

## Philosophy

Great proposals don't describe your product. They describe your buyer's **future success**.

The best sales proposals:
1. **Lead with outcomes, not features** — Buyers care about their results, not your capabilities
2. **Make the decision easy** — Remove friction, objections, and confusion
3. **Tell a story** — Context → Challenge → Solution → Success
4. **Respect the reader's time** — Every section earns its place

## How This Skill Works

When invoked, apply the guidelines in `rules/` organized by:

- `structure-*` — Proposal architecture, components, flow
- `executive-*` — Executive summary, C-level communication
- `pricing-*` — Pricing presentation, anchoring, packaging
- `sow-*` — Statement of Work, deliverables, timelines
- `rfp-*` — RFP response strategy, compliance, win themes
- `design-*` — Formatting, layout, visual hierarchy
- `strategy-*` — Competitive positioning, follow-up, negotiation

## Core Frameworks

### The Proposal Pyramid

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   Executive     │  ← Why this matters (1 page)
                    │    Summary      │
                    ├─────────────────┤
                    │   Solution &    │  ← How we solve it (2-3 pages)
                    │    Approach     │
                    ├─────────────────┤
                    │   Investment &  │  ← What it costs (1-2 pages)
                    │    Timeline     │
                    ├─────────────────┤
                    │   Proof &       │  ← Why trust us (1-2 pages)
                    │   Credibility   │
                    └─────────────────┘
```

### Proposal Types by Deal Stage

| Type | Purpose | Length | Timeline |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| **One-Pager** | Early qualification | 1 page | Same day |
| **Solution Brief** | Mid-funnel engagement | 3-5 pages | 2-3 days |
| **Full Proposal** | Final presentation | 8-15 pages | 5-10 days |
| **RFP Response** | Formal bid | Variable | Per deadline |
| **SOW** | Contract scope | 3-10 pages | Post-verbal |

### The CLOSE Framework

Every proposal section should CLOSE:

- **C**ontext — Where the buyer is today
- **L**oss — What it's costing them (pain)
- **O**utcome — The desired future state
- **S**olution — How you get them there
- **E**vidence — Proof it works

### Pricing Presentation Matrix

| Element | Purpose | Placement |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Value Summary** | Anchor on ROI before price | Before pricing |
| **Investment Options** | Give control, not ultimatum | 2-3 tiers |
| **Package Comparison** | Make preferred option obvious | Side-by-side table |
| **Terms & Conditions** | Reduce friction | After pricing |
| **Next Steps** | Create momentum | Final section |

### Proposal Win Factors

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    PROPOSAL SUCCESS                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│   40% — Relationship & access (built before proposal)       │
│   25% — Solution fit (do you solve the problem?)            │
│   20% — Presentation (is it compelling and clear?)          │
│   15% — Pricing (is it defensible and competitive?)         │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Proposal Components

| Component | Required | Purpose | Common Mistakes |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Cover Page** | Yes | First impression, branding | Generic, no personalization |
| **Executive Summary** | Yes | Decision-maker snapshot | Too long, feature-focused |
| **Understanding** | Yes | Prove you listened | Assumptions, not discovery |
| **Solution Overview** | Yes | What you propose | Feature dump |
| **Approach/Methodology** | Depends | How you'll do it | Too technical |
| **Timeline** | Yes | When they get value | Unrealistic dates |
| **Investment** | Yes | Total cost of ownership | Hidden costs surface later |
| **Team/About Us** | Optional | Build confidence | Self-congratulatory |
| **Case Studies** | Recommended | Social proof | Irrelevant industry |
| **Terms & Conditions** | Yes | Protect both parties | Buried gotchas |
| **Next Steps** | Yes | Drive action | Vague, no urgency |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Feature dumping** — Listing everything you can do vs. what they need
- **One-size-fits-all** — Using templates without customization
- **Price-first** — Showing cost before establishing value
- **Competitor bashing** — Direct attacks backfire; focus on your strengths
- **Wall of text** — No visual hierarchy, hard to scan
- **Jargon overload** — Internal terminology the buyer doesn't know
- **Missing next steps** — Proposal ends with no clear action
- **Over-promising** — Timelines and outcomes you can't deliver
- **Ghosting** — No follow-up strategy after sending
