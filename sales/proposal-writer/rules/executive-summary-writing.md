## Executive Summary Writing

**Impact: CRITICAL**

The executive summary is often the only page that gets read by the final decision-maker. It must stand alone and compel action.

### The One-Page Rule

Executives have 2-3 minutes. Your exec summary must:
- Fit on one page (max)
- Be readable without context
- Answer "why should I care?"
- Lead to a clear decision

### Executive Summary Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                         │

│  2. CHALLENGE (2-3 sentences)                               │

### Good Example: Strong Executive Summary

```markdown
## Executive Summary

**Prepared for:** Jennifer Martinez, CTO, ScaleUp Inc.
**Date:** March 15, 2025

### The Opportunity

ScaleUp Inc. is positioning for a Series C raise in Q4 2025, with SOC 2
Type II compliance as a critical requirement for enterprise customer
acquisition. Your engineering team is growing 3x this year, requiring
secure, scalable infrastructure that doesn't slow development velocity.

### The Challenge

Current secrets management practices are creating measurable risk:
- **$180K projected annual cost** from developer productivity loss
- **12-week SOC 2 gap** in credentials management controls
- **2 security incidents** in the past 6 months traced to exposed secrets

Without addressing these gaps, the Series C timeline and enterprise
sales pipeline are at risk.

### Our Recommendation

We propose implementing SecretStash Enterprise across your engineering
organization, providing:

- Centralized secrets management with automated rotation
- SOC 2-compliant audit trails and access controls
- Developer-friendly CLI and IDE integrations
- SSO integration with your existing Okta instance

### Expected Outcomes

| Metric | Current | With SecretStash | Impact |
|--------|---------|------------------|--------|
| Developer onboarding | 3 weeks | 4 days | 75% faster |
| Secret rotation | Manual/20 hrs/mo | Automated | 240 hrs/year saved |
| Security incidents | 2/quarter | 0 projected | Risk elimination |
| SOC 2 readiness | 12-week gap | Compliant | Series C enablement |

### Investment

**Total Year 1 Investment:** $84,000
**Projected Year 1 ROI:** 3.2x ($270,000 in quantified value)
**Implementation Timeline:** 6 weeks to full deployment

### Next Step

We recommend a 30-minute alignment call with your security and
engineering leads to finalize scope and begin implementation planning.

**Why it fails:**
- About the vendor, not the customer
- No mention of customer's specific situation
- Generic features, not outcomes
- No quantified value or ROI
- No clear recommendation or next step
- Requires reading more to understand value

### Executive Summary Formulas

**The "Because" Formula:**
```
[Client] should move forward with [solution] because:
1. [Business outcome 1]
2. [Business outcome 2]
3. [Risk mitigation]

The investment of [amount] returns [ROI] within [timeframe].
```

**The "If/Then" Formula:**
```
If [client] wants to achieve [goal] by [date], then [solution] is
the fastest path because [differentiator].

Without action, [cost of inaction].
```

**The "3-3-3" Formula:**
```
3 sentences on their situation
3 bullets on your solution
3 outcomes they'll achieve
```

### Writing Tips for Executives

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use their language from discovery | Use your internal jargon |
| Quantify everything possible | Use vague qualifiers |
| Name specific stakeholders | Be generic |
| Include a clear recommendation | End with "let us know" |
| Make it scannable | Write dense paragraphs |
| Lead with outcomes | Lead with features |

### Executive Summary Checklist

Before sending, verify:

```
□ Fits on one page
□ Client company name appears in first paragraph
□ Specific challenge/pain is stated
□ Cost of inaction is quantified
□ Solution is summarized (not detailed)
□ 3+ specific, measurable outcomes listed
□ Investment amount is clear
□ ROI or value is stated
□ Timeline is included
□ Clear next step with specific action
□ Can stand alone without reading full proposal
```

### Outcomes That Resonate by Persona

| Persona | Outcome Language |
|---------|------------------|
| **CEO** | Revenue, competitive advantage, market position |
| **CFO** | ROI, cost reduction, risk mitigation |
| **CTO** | Technical excellence, scalability, team productivity |
| **VP Sales** | Win rates, deal velocity, customer retention |
| **VP Ops** | Efficiency, automation, error reduction |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Company history** — No one cares about your founding story here
- **Feature lists** — Save for solution section
- **Passive voice** — "It is recommended" vs. "We recommend"
- **Missing numbers** — Execs want quantification
- **Too long** — If it's 2+ pages, it's not an exec summary
- **Buried recommendation** — Put the ask clearly at the end
