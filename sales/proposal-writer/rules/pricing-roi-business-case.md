## ROI & Business Case Presentation

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Every B2B purchase requires internal justification. Your proposal must arm your champion with the business case to sell internally.

### The Business Case Framework

### Value Quantification Categories

| Category | Value Type | Example Metrics |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Revenue Increase** | Hard | New customers, expansion, faster deals |
| **Cost Reduction** | Hard | Headcount efficiency, tool consolidation |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Hard/Soft | Incidents prevented, compliance fines |
| **Productivity Gains** | Medium | Time saved, faster processes |
| **Strategic Enablement** | Soft | Market positioning, competitive advantage |

### Good Example: Complete ROI Analysis

## Business Case & ROI Analysis

### Investment Summary

| Component | Year 1 | Years 2-3 |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Platform License | $72,000 | $72,000/year |
| Implementation Services | $12,000 | — |
| Training | $4,000 | — |
| **Total Year 1** | **$88,000** | |
| **Annual Recurring** | | **$72,000** |

### Quantified Value

We've identified four categories of measurable value based on
your current metrics and industry benchmarks:

#### 1. Developer Productivity Recovery
| Metric | Current | Projected | Calculation |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Onboarding time | 15 days | 4 days | 11 days saved |
| New hires/year | 50 | 50 | |
| Loaded daily cost | $600 | $600 | |
| **Annual Value** | | | **$330,000** |

#### 2. Security Incident Prevention
| Metric | Current | Projected | Calculation |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Incidents/year | 8 | 1 | 7 prevented |
| Avg. cost/incident | $15,000 | $15,000 | |
| **Annual Value** | | | **$105,000** |

#### 3. Manual Process Elimination
| Metric | Current | Projected | Calculation |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Hours/month (rotation) | 40 | 2 | 38 hours saved |
| Hours/month (auditing) | 20 | 4 | 16 hours saved |
| Blended hourly rate | $85 | $85 | |
| **Annual Value** | | | **$55,080** |

#### 4. Compliance Acceleration
| Metric | Current | Projected | Calculation |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| SOC 2 audit prep | 12 weeks | 4 weeks | 8 weeks saved |
| Team members | 3 | 3 | |
| Weeks @ $4,000/person | $96,000 | $48,000 | |
| **One-Time Value** | | | **$48,000** |

### Total Value & ROI

| Timeframe | Investment | Value | Net Value | ROI |
|-----------|------------|-------|-----------|-----|
| Year 1 | $88,000 | $538,080 | $450,080 | **512%** |
| Year 2 | $72,000 | $490,080 | $418,080 | 581% |
| Year 3 | $72,000 | $490,080 | $418,080 | 581% |
| **3-Year Total** | **$232,000** | **$1,518,240** | **$1,286,240** | **554%** |

### Payback Period

```
Initial Investment:     $88,000
Monthly Value:          $44,840
Payback Period:         2.0 months
```

### Sensitivity Analysis

Even with conservative assumptions, the business case remains strong:

| Scenario | Value Assumption | Year 1 ROI |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| Conservative | 50% of projected | 206% |
| Moderate | 75% of projected | 359% |
| Expected | 100% of projected | 512% |

### Cost of Inaction

Choosing to delay or not proceed carries quantifiable risk:

| Risk | Annual Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Continued productivity loss | $330,000 |
| Projected security incidents | $120,000 |
| Manual process burden | $55,080 |
| Compliance delay (opportunity cost) | $200,000+ |
| **Total Annual Cost of Inaction** | **$705,080** |
```

### Bad Example: Vague ROI Claims

```markdown
## Return on Investment

SecretStash delivers significant ROI for our customers:

- Improved security posture
- Faster developer onboarding
- Better compliance readiness
- Reduced operational burden

Customers typically see ROI within the first year. Our platform
pays for itself through improved efficiency and reduced risk.

Contact us to discuss how we can calculate ROI for your specific
situation.
```

**Why it fails:**
- No numbers or calculations
- Generic claims that could apply to anyone
- Doesn't use customer's actual data
- "Contact us" is a dead end
- No cost of inaction
- Buyer can't use this to justify internally

### ROI Calculation Methods

**Simple ROI:**
```
ROI = (Value - Investment) / Investment × 100

Example: ($538,000 - $88,000) / $88,000 = 512%
```

**Payback Period:**
```
Payback = Total Investment / Monthly Value

Example: $88,000 / $44,840 = 1.96 months
```

**Net Present Value (for CFOs):**
```
NPV = Σ (Cash Flow / (1 + discount rate)^n) - Initial Investment
```

**Total Cost of Ownership:**
```
TCO = License + Implementation + Training + Maintenance + Internal Time
```

### Value Discovery Questions

Ask these during discovery to build your business case:

| Value Area | Discovery Questions |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Productivity** | How long does X take today? How many people? How often? |
| **Cost** | What are you spending on current solution? Hidden costs? |
| **Risk** | What happens when X fails? Has it happened? What did it cost? |
| **Revenue** | Does this block deals? Slow sales? Lose customers? |
| **Strategic** | What could you do if this problem was solved? |

### Making Numbers Credible

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Use their data** | "Based on the 50 hires you mentioned..." |
| **Cite benchmarks** | "Industry average is X; we typically see Y" |
| **Show calculation** | Don't just show result; show the math |
| **Provide ranges** | "Conservative to optimistic: $200K-$400K" |
| **Reference proof points** | "Similar customer achieved Z" |

### Business Case Presentation Tips

**For CFOs:**
- Lead with hard costs and payback period
- Include TCO comparison
- Show sensitivity analysis
- Use conservative numbers

**For CEOs:**
- Lead with strategic outcomes
- Connect to company goals/OKRs
- Show competitive implications
- Include cost of inaction

**For VPs:**
- Lead with team impact
- Show productivity gains
- Include timeline to value
- Address change management

### Anti-Patterns

- **Inflated numbers** — Credibility dies when numbers seem unrealistic
- **Missing sources** — Where did the benchmark come from?
- **Too complex** — Keep it simple enough to repeat in a meeting
- **No sensitivity** — Always show conservative scenario
- **Forgetting TCO** — Hidden costs in current state help your case
- **Value without timeline** — When do they realize the value?
