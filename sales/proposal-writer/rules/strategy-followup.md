## Proposal Follow-Up Strategy

**Impact: HIGH**

Most deals are lost in the follow-up, not the proposal. A great proposal without follow-up is just content marketing.

### The Follow-Up Reality

### The Follow-Up Framework

| Timing | Action | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Day 0** | Send proposal | Initial delivery |
| **Day 0 + 2 hrs** | Confirmation call/message | Ensure receipt, gauge reaction |
| **Day 2** | Value-add email | Answer anticipated questions |
| **Day 5** | Check-in call | Understand where they are |
| **Day 7** | New information email | Add value, create reason to engage |
| **Day 10** | Decision timeline check | Get commitment to timeline |
| **Day 14+** | Periodic touches | Stay top of mind |

### Same-Day Follow-Up (Critical)

**Within 2 hours of sending:**

```
Subject: Just sent over the TechCorp proposal - quick question

Hi Sarah,

Just sent the proposal over - you should have it in your inbox.
Wanted to make sure it landed and see if you have any initial
questions as you review.

Also curious: what's the best way to get on Jennifer's calendar
to walk through the executive summary together? I know her time
is limited - happy to do 15 minutes focused on the ROI section.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Why same-day matters:**
- Confirms receipt
- Shows engagement
- Catches early objections
- Establishes you're available

### Day 2: The Value-Add Follow-Up

**Add value, don't just "check in":**

```
Subject: Additional resource for your secrets management evaluation

Hi Sarah,

As you review the proposal, thought this might be helpful:

I put together a quick comparison of implementation timelines
based on what we've seen with companies at your stage.

[Attached: Implementation Timeline Comparison]

Most relevant for you:
- Our fastest similar implementation was 3 weeks
- The blocker is usually SSO configuration (which you already have)
- We can run migration in parallel with your April hiring wave

Let me know if useful, or if other questions came up as you reviewed.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Value-add ideas:**
- Additional case study (relevant industry)
- ROI calculator customized to their data
- Implementation timeline comparison
- Technical deep-dive on specific feature
- Relevant article/research
- Customer reference connection

### Day 5: The Check-In Call

**Call script (not voicemail if possible):**

```
"Hi Sarah, following up on the proposal from Tuesday.

I wanted to see:
1. Did the executive summary resonate with Jennifer?
2. Any sections that need more detail?
3. What's your timeline looking like for a decision?

[Listen actively]

Would it be helpful if I joined the next internal discussion
to answer questions in real-time?"
```

**If voicemail:**
```
"Hi Sarah, [Name] from SecretStash. Following up on the proposal.

I had a thought about your SOC 2 timeline that might be useful -
can you give me 5 minutes when you have a chance?

[Phone number]. Looking forward to connecting."
```

### Handling Common Stalls

| They Say | They Mean | Your Response |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| "We're still reviewing" | No urgency | "What would help move forward?" |
| "Waiting on budget" | Finance blocker | "Can I help build the business case?" |
| "Need to talk to [X]" | Not the decider | "Can I join that conversation?" |
| "Timing isn't right" | Priorities shifted | "When should we reconnect?" |
| "Need more time" | Could be anything | "What specific concerns can I address?" |

### Reactivation Sequences

**When proposal goes cold (2+ weeks silent):**

**Email 1 (Day 14):**
```
Subject: TechCorp proposal - still relevant?

Hi Sarah,

I wanted to check if the proposal we discussed is still being
considered. I know priorities shift.

If timing has changed, no problem - I'd rather know so I can
close out my notes and reconnect when it makes sense.

If it is still active, what's blocking the next step?

Best,
[Name]
```

**Email 2 (Day 21):**
```
Subject: Quick update for TechCorp

Hi Sarah,

Wanted to share a quick update - we just published results from
a customer in a similar situation to yours:

- 4-week implementation (vs. your 6-week target)
- 92% developer adoption in first month
- SOC 2 audit passed 6 weeks post-deployment

Would their experience be useful context? Happy to connect you.

Either way, let me know where things stand.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Email 3 (Day 28 - The Breakup):**
```
Subject: Closing the loop on TechCorp

Hi Sarah,

I haven't heard back, which usually means one of three things:

1. Timing changed and this isn't a priority right now
2. You went with another solution
3. My emails are going to spam

If it's (1), I'd love to know when to check back in.
If it's (2), I'd appreciate feedback on what swayed the decision.
If it's (3), I'll try carrier pigeon next.

Either way, I'll close this out on my end unless I hear from you.
It's been great working with you - door's always open.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Multi-Threading Strategy

**Don't rely on one contact:**

| Contact | Purpose | Engagement |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Champion | Internal selling | Weekly touch |
| Economic buyer | Final approval | Key moments only |
| Technical evaluator | Validation | As needed |
| Procurement | Process | When active |

**Multi-thread outreach:**

```
To Champion (Day 3):
"Any questions from the team as you circulate the proposal?"

To Technical Lead (Day 5):
"Wanted to make sure the integration section addressed your questions"

To Economic Buyer (Day 7, via Champion intro):
"Would be valuable to walk Jennifer through the ROI section"
```

### Negotiation Response Framework

**When they ask for discount:**

1. **Understand the why:** "Help me understand - is it budget, or value?"
2. **Reframe to value:** "Let's make sure the ROI justifies the investment"
3. **Trade, don't give:** "If we could do X, would you sign this week?"
4. **Protect your walk-away:** Know your floor before negotiating

**Trade options instead of discounts:**
- Multi-year commitment
- Upfront payment
- Expanded scope / more users
- Case study participation
- Press release / public reference
- Reduced scope / phased approach

### The "Proposal Review" Meeting

**Request this meeting, don't just send and hope:**

```
"Rather than you reading through 15 pages, can we do 30 minutes
where I walk you through the key sections? I can focus on what
matters most to you and answer questions in real-time."
```

**Meeting structure:**
- 5 min: Confirm understanding (did we capture your situation?)
- 10 min: Solution highlights (what we propose)
- 5 min: Investment & ROI (the business case)
- 10 min: Questions & concerns

### Tracking Follow-Up Activity

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Same-day confirmation | 100% | Ensure receipt |
| Day 5 touch | 100% | Maintain momentum |
| Multi-thread attempts | 2+ contacts | Reduce single-point risk |
| Days to next meeting | < 7 | Keep deal active |
| Proposal-to-decision | < 30 days | Shorter cycles, higher win rate |

### Anti-Patterns

- **"Just checking in"** — Always add value
- **One-and-done** — Most deals need 5+ touches
- **Same channel** — Mix email, call, LinkedIn
- **Only talking to champion** — Multi-thread
- **Waiting for them** — You drive the timeline
- **Radio silence after proposal** — Most common mistake
- **Discounting without getting** — Always trade for something
