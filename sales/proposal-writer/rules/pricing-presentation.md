## Pricing Presentation & Investment Positioning

**Impact: CRITICAL**

How you present pricing determines perceived value. Price is never just a number—it's a story about worth.

### The Golden Rule of Pricing Presentation

**Never show price before establishing value.**

```
WRONG:  Price → Justify → Hope they see value
RIGHT:  Value → Anchor → Present investment → Reinforce ROI
```

### Pricing Psychology Fundamentals

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Anchoring** | Show larger number first (total value, competitor price, cost of inaction) |
| **Decoy Effect** | Include a package that makes your preferred option look better |
| **Loss Aversion** | Frame around what they lose by not acting |
| **Precise Numbers** | $84,750 feels calculated; $85,000 feels arbitrary |
| **Investment Language** | "Investment" not "cost" or "price" |

### The Value-First Pricing Structure

### Good Example: Strategic Pricing Presentation

## Investment & ROI

### Value Summary

Based on our discovery and analysis, implementing SecretStash
will deliver the following quantified value:

| Value Driver | Annual Impact |
|-------------|---------------|
| Developer productivity recovery | $120,000 |
| Security incident prevention | $80,000 |
| Compliance acceleration | $50,000 |
| Manual rotation elimination | $20,000 |
| **Total Annual Value** | **$270,000** |

### Investment Options

We've prepared three implementation approaches based on your
stated priorities and timeline:

| | Foundation | Professional | Enterprise |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Best For** | Core needs | Recommended | Full platform |
| | | **MOST POPULAR** | |
| Secret Management | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Automated Rotation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| SSO Integration | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Dedicated Support | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Custom Training | — | — | ✓ |
| On-prem Option | — | — | ✓ |
| **Users Included** | 50 | 150 | Unlimited |
| **Annual Investment** | $36,000 | $84,000 | $156,000 |
| **Monthly Equivalent** | $3,000/mo | $7,000/mo | $13,000/mo |

### Our Recommendation

Based on your growth trajectory (50 → 200 engineers) and
SOC 2 timeline, we recommend **Professional** as it:

- Scales with your team without per-seat upgrades
- Includes SSO integration you'll need for compliance
- Provides dedicated support during implementation

### Return on Investment

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Year 1 Investment | $84,000 |
| Year 1 Value | $270,000 |
| **Net Value** | **$186,000** |
| **ROI** | **3.2x** |
| **Payback Period** | **4 months** |

### Payment Options

To accommodate budget cycles, we offer:

- **Annual (recommended):** $84,000 — includes 2 months free
- **Semi-annual:** $42,000 × 2 payments
- **Quarterly:** $24,000 × 4 payments (10% premium)
```

### Our Plans

| Plan | Price |
|------|-------|
| Basic | $2,000/month |

### Add-ons

- SSO Integration: $500/month
- Priority Support: $1,000/month

- Professional Services: $200/hour

### Terms

All plans require annual commitment. 30-day notice required
for cancellation. Prices subject to change.

Contact your sales representative for a custom quote.
```

**Why it fails:**
- Price shown with no value context
- Generic plans with no alignment to customer needs
- Add-ons feel like nickel-and-diming
- No ROI or payback calculation
- No recommendation
- "Contact us" creates friction
- Defensive terms instead of partnership language

### The 3-Option Strategy

Always present 2-3 options. Never just one price.

```
Option 1 (Low)      Option 2 (Target)    Option 3 (High)
├─────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────┤
│ Entry point     │ Where you want       │ Premium anchor    │
│ Smaller scope   │ them to land         │ Makes target      │
│ Limited value   │ Best value/fit       │ look reasonable   │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

**Naming your options:**
```
Generic (weak):     Basic, Standard, Premium
Value-based (good): Foundation, Growth, Scale
Outcome-based:      Launch, Accelerate, Transform
```

### Anchoring Techniques

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Value Anchor** | "This delivers $270K in value for an investment of $84K" |
| **Cost-of-Inaction Anchor** | "Current approach costs $180K/year; solution costs $84K" |
| **Competitor Anchor** | "Comparable solutions range from $100K-$200K annually" |
| **Per-Unit Reframe** | "$700/engineer/year — less than one hour of lost productivity weekly" |
| **Daily Breakdown** | "That's $230/day for enterprise-grade security" |

### Price Objection Prevention

Build these into your pricing section:

| Objection | Prevention |
|-----------|------------|
| "Too expensive" | Lead with value, show ROI |
| "Over budget" | Offer payment terms, phased approach |
| "Need to compare" | Position against alternatives preemptively |
| "Not in plan" | Show cost of delay |
| "Need discount" | Build value-adds instead of price cuts |

### Discount Strategy

**Never discount without getting something:**

| They Ask For | You Can Exchange |
|--------------|------------------|
| 10% discount | Annual prepay, case study, referral |
| 15% discount | Multi-year commitment, press release |
| 20%+ discount | Expanded scope, pilot program, advisory board |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Hidden costs** — All-in pricing or buyers lose trust
- **Too many options** — 3 max; more creates paralysis
- **Round numbers** — $84,750 > $85,000 for perceived precision
- **Price at the end** — Some execs flip to pricing first; make it standalone
- **Apology language** — "Our pricing is..." with defensive tone
- **Missing recommendation** — Tell them which option and why
