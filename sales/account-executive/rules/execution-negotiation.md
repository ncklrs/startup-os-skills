## Negotiation and Closing Excellence

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Negotiation isn't about winning against your customer — it's about reaching an agreement that works for both sides. Great closers negotiate from strength, know when to hold and when to flex, and always protect the value of what they're selling.

### The Negotiation Mindset

**You're not adversaries. You're solving a puzzle together.**

| Losing Mindset | Winning Mindset |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "How do I extract maximum price?" | "How do we reach a fair deal?" |
| "Give nothing away" | "Trade, don't give" |
| "Procurement is the enemy" | "Procurement has a job to do" |
| "Close at any cost" | "Close the right deals at fair value" |

### When Negotiation Begins

**Negotiation doesn't start when you send the proposal. It starts at first contact.**

```
Timeline:
DISCOVERY → SCOPING → VALIDATION → PROPOSAL → NEGOTIATION → CLOSE
   ↑                                              ↑
   Negotiation                           Where most think
   actually starts                       negotiation starts
```

**Early actions that determine negotiation position:**
- Value established (or not)
- Competition positioned (or not)
- Champion enabled (or not)
- Executive engaged (or not)
- Urgency created (or not)

### Pre-Negotiation Checklist

Before sending any proposal, verify:

| Dimension | Verified | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Value proposition is understood | Y/N | |
| ROI/business case is accepted | Y/N | |
| Decision criteria are clear | Y/N | |
| Economic Buyer is engaged | Y/N | |
| Champion is aligned on approach | Y/N | |
| Competition is understood | Y/N | |
| Budget range is known | Y/N | |
| Timeline is confirmed | Y/N | |
| Procurement process is mapped | Y/N | |

**If you can't answer "Yes" to most of these, you're not ready to propose.**

### Pricing Presentation Framework

**Present price in context of value:**

```
"Based on our discussions, you're looking to [outcome 1] and [outcome 2].
Companies like yours typically see [specific ROI metrics].

For your needs — [scope summary] — the investment is $X annually.

Given the $Y impact we've identified, you're looking at a [Z]x return.
Most customers see payback within [timeframe]."
```

**Never email pricing without context.** Present live, then follow up in writing.

### Common Objections and Responses

**"The price is too high"**

```
"I hear you. Let's unpack that. Compared to what? Is it the total
investment, the per-seat cost, or something else?"

[Then address based on their answer]

If budget: "What budget were you expecting? Let me see if there's
a way to structure this that works."

If competitors: "What pricing did they share? Let me help you
compare apples to apples — there may be scope differences."

If value: "Help me understand which outcomes we discussed are
most important. We can potentially adjust scope to match budget."
```

**"We need a discount"**

```
"I want to find a way to work together. Before we discuss price
adjustments, help me understand what's driving the ask. Is this
about budget constraints, competitive pricing, or company policy?"

[Then trade, don't give]

"I can offer [X discount] if we can [longer contract, faster close,
larger deployment, case study participation, reference calls]."
```

**"Let me check with [stakeholder]"**

```
"Of course. What specific concerns might they have? I want to
make sure you have what you need to represent our value."

[Offer support]

"Would it help if I joined that conversation? Or I can prepare
a one-pager addressing their likely questions."
```

**"We're going with [competitor]"**

```
"I appreciate you letting me know. Can I ask what tipped the
decision? I'd value the feedback, even if we don't win this one."

[Listen, then if appropriate]

"Those are fair points. Before you finalize, would it be worth
a quick call to address [specific concern]? I want to make sure
you have complete information for your decision."
```

### Negotiation Tactics

**Trade, Don't Give:**

| If They Ask For | You Can Ask For |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Lower price | Longer contract term |
| More discount | Faster signature |
| Extended payment terms | Larger deployment |
| Additional features | Case study/reference |
| Pilot/POC | Defined success criteria with commitment |

**Anchor High:**
- First number sets the range
- Present full value, full price first
- Discounting from high anchor feels like a win

**Create Urgency (Real, Not Fake):**
```
"Our implementation team is booking into Q3. To guarantee a Q2
start, we'd need contracts signed by [date]."

"Our pricing is set through end of quarter. I can't guarantee
we can hold this pricing if we push into Q3."
```

**Use Silence:**
- After making your proposal, stop talking
- Uncomfortable silence is powerful
- Let them fill the void

### The Procurement Dance

**Understanding procurement's job:**
- Get the best price
- Protect the company (legal, security)
- Follow proper process
- Document the decision

**Working with procurement:**

```
"I want to make this as easy as possible for you. Can you walk
me through your standard procurement process? What documentation
do you typically need?"

"Who else needs to review the contract? Legal? Security? Let me
get ahead of their questions."

"What's your timeline for completing procurement? I'll work
backward from there to ensure we don't hold anything up."
```

### Closing Techniques

**The Assumptive Close:**
```
"Based on our conversations, it sounds like we're aligned.
Let me send over the contract this afternoon. What email should
I use for DocuSign?"
```

**The Timeline Close:**
```
"You mentioned needing this implemented by Q2. Working backward,
that means contracts by [date] to allow for [implementation time].
Can we plan to sign by then?"
```

**The Summary Close:**
```
"Let me make sure we're on the same page. You need [outcome],
we've agreed on [scope] at [price], and you want to start by
[date]. The next step is contract signature. Are we good to
proceed?"
```

**The Direct Close:**
```
"We've covered everything you needed. Are you ready to move forward?"
```

### Handling Last-Minute Demands

**When procurement asks for more at the last minute:**

```
"I understand. We've already reached what I believe is a fair
deal. If [new demand] is essential, I'd need to revisit
[something on their side]. Can we discuss what tradeoff makes
sense?"
```

**When to walk away:**
- Deal economics don't work
- Terms expose company to risk
- Precedent would harm future deals
- Customer will never be successful

```
"I've done everything I can to make this work. Unfortunately,
I can't go further on [specific ask]. If that's a dealbreaker,
I understand. The door is always open if circumstances change."
```

### Post-Close Execution

**The deal isn't done until:**

| Milestone | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Contract signed | Confirm receipt, thank customer |
| Payment received | Verify with finance |
| Implementation kicked off | Warm handoff to CS/implementation |
| First value delivered | Check in personally |
| Champion acknowledged | Thank them, set up for expansion |

### Negotiation Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Might Mean | Action |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| No urgency from customer | Low priority, testing pricing | Re-establish urgency |
| Procurement before EB alignment | Going through motions | Get back to decision maker |
| Constantly adding demands | Not negotiating in good faith | Hold firm or walk |
| "Legal is still reviewing" | Stalling | Offer to address legal directly |
| Champion goes quiet | Internal issues | Direct conversation |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Discounting without trading** — Training them to ask for more
- **Emailing pricing** — Losing control of the conversation
- **Proposal before value** — Price looks high without context
- **Caving to pressure** — Sets bad precedent
- **Ignoring procurement** — They have power, work with them
- **Happy ears** — Assuming "let me think about it" means yes
- **Over-negotiating** — Winning the battle, losing the relationship
- **Desperation** — Customers smell it and exploit it
