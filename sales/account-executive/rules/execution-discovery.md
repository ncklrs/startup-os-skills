## Discovery Excellence

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Discovery is where deals are won or lost — not in the demo, not in the proposal, but in how deeply you understand the customer's world. Great discovery creates champions, surfaces deal risks, and builds the foundation for everything that follows.

### The Discovery Mindset

**Discovery is not interrogation. It's a conversation where you:**
- Understand their world better than they expect
- Surface pain they didn't know how to articulate
- Establish yourself as a trusted advisor
- Qualify whether this is a real opportunity
- Build the case for change

### Discovery Framework: The Customer Journey

```
1. CURRENT STATE
   "Where are you today?"
   - Current processes
   - Current tools
   - Current results

2. PROBLEMS/PAIN
   "What's not working?"
   - Symptoms
   - Root causes
   - Impact

3. FUTURE STATE
   "Where do you want to be?"
   - Desired outcomes
   - Success metrics
   - Timeline

4. GAP ANALYSIS
   "What's preventing you from getting there?"
   - Obstacles
   - Previous attempts
   - Why now?
```

### Discovery Questions by Category

**Opening Questions (Establish Context):**

```
"Help me understand your role — what does success look like for
you this year?"

"Give me the 2-minute version of how [process] works at your
company today."

"What prompted you to take this meeting? What's happening that
made this a priority?"
```

**Problem Questions (Surface Pain):**

```
"Walk me through the last time [problem scenario] happened.
What was the impact?"

"When you think about the biggest challenges in [area], what
keeps you up at night?"

"If I talked to your team, what frustrations would they share?"

"What have you tried before to solve this? What worked? What didn't?"
```

**Impact Questions (Quantify Value):**

```
"When [problem] happens, what does it cost you? In time? In money?
In opportunity?"

"If this doesn't get solved, what happens? What's the cost of
doing nothing?"

"If you could wave a magic wand and fix this, what would the
impact be on [metric]?"
```

**Timeline Questions (Establish Urgency):**

```
"When do you need this solved by? What's driving that timeline?"

"What happens if you don't have a solution in place by [date]?"

"Are there budget cycles or planning periods I should be aware of?"
```

**Decision Process Questions (Map the Journey):**

```
"Walk me through how decisions like this typically get made here."

"Who else would need to be involved in evaluating this?"

"Have you made a purchase like this before? What was that process like?"

"What would need to be true for you to move forward?"
```

### The Pain Funnel

Dig deeper until you hit real pain:

```
SURFACE → "We need to improve efficiency"
         ↓
PROBLEM → "Our team spends too much time on manual work"
         ↓
CAUSE   → "Our current system doesn't integrate with our other tools"
         ↓
IMPACT  → "We lose 10 hours per person per week"
         ↓
COST    → "That's $500K annually in lost productivity"
         ↓
URGENCY → "And we can't scale for next year's growth targets"
```

**Probing deeper:**

```
"Tell me more about that."
"What do you mean by [term they used]?"
"Can you give me an example?"
"How long has this been going on?"
"What happens if this doesn't get fixed?"
"Why hasn't this been solved before?"
```

### Active Listening Techniques

**Mirroring:** Repeat the last few words as a question
```
Customer: "We've been struggling with this for months."
You: "Struggling for months?"
```

**Labeling:** Name the emotion or dynamic
```
"It sounds like this has been frustrating for you."
"It seems like there's pressure from leadership to fix this."
```

**Summarizing:** Reflect back what you heard
```
"Let me make sure I've got this right. You're dealing with [problem],
which is causing [impact], and you need to solve this by [date]
because [urgency]. Is that accurate?"
```

### Discovery Meeting Structure

**30-Minute Discovery Call:**

```
[0-2 min] OPENING
"Thanks for making time. I've done some research but would love
to hear directly from you. Let's start with what prompted this
conversation..."

[2-15 min] PROBLEM EXPLORATION
Deep dive into current state, problems, impact
Use open questions, go deep on 2-3 key issues

[15-20 min] FUTURE STATE
Where they want to be, success metrics, timeline

[20-25 min] DECISION PROCESS
Who's involved, how decisions get made, timeline

[25-30 min] NEXT STEPS
Summarize, align on logical next step
"Based on what you've shared, the logical next step would be..."
```

### Discovery Note-Taking

**Capture these in every discovery:**

| Category | Capture | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Pain statements** | Direct quotes | Use their words back to them |
| **Metrics** | Numbers, percentages | Builds business case |
| **Names** | People mentioned | Multi-threading leads |
| **Timeline triggers** | Dates, events | Creates urgency |
| **Competition** | Alternatives mentioned | Competitive intel |
| **Objections** | Concerns raised | Address proactively |
| **Buying process** | Steps mentioned | Map to your process |

### Discovery Quality Checklist

After every discovery, verify:

| Dimension | Verified? | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Pain is quantified ($ or time) | Y/N | |
| Impact on business goals is clear | Y/N | |
| Timeline and urgency understood | Y/N | |
| Decision process mapped | Y/N | |
| Key stakeholders identified | Y/N | |
| Budget range confirmed | Y/N | |
| Champion potential assessed | Y/N | |
| Competition identified | Y/N | |

**If you can't check most boxes, you need more discovery.**

### Common Discovery Mistakes

**Bad Discovery Example:**

```
AE: "Tell me about your challenges with [area]?"
Customer: "We have some inefficiencies."
AE: "Got it. Let me show you how we solve that."
[Launches into demo]
```

**Problems:**
- No quantified pain
- No understanding of impact
- No decision process
- No qualification
- Customer not engaged

**Good Discovery Example:**

```
AE: "Tell me about your challenges with [area]?"
Customer: "We have some inefficiencies."
AE: "Inefficiencies — help me understand that. What does that
look like day-to-day for your team?"
Customer: "Well, my team spends about 2 hours a day on manual
data entry between systems."
AE: "Two hours per day — that's significant. How many people
on your team deal with this?"
Customer: "About 20 people."
AE: "So 40 hours of manual work every day. What's the fully-
loaded cost of an hour of your team's time?"
Customer: "Probably around $50/hour."
AE: "That's $2,000 per day, or roughly $500K per year on manual
work. Is that a number that gets attention from leadership?"
Customer: "Absolutely. My VP has been pushing us to find a solution."
AE: "Tell me about that conversation with your VP..."
```

### Transitioning from Discovery

**When discovery is complete:**

```
"Based on everything you've shared, it sounds like [summary of
pain], which is costing you [quantified impact], and you need
this solved by [timeline] because [urgency].

The logical next step would be [demo/technical review/exec meeting]
where I can show you specifically how we address [their priorities].
I'd want [relevant stakeholders] involved so we can address their
questions. Does that make sense for [date]?"
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Feature-first** — Jumping to demo before understanding
- **Interrogation mode** — Firing questions without listening
- **Accepting surface answers** — Not digging deeper
- **Talking too much** — Discovery is about listening
- **No note-taking** — Forgetting crucial details
- **One discovery and done** — Needs multiple conversations
- **Skipping decision process** — Knowing pain but not path to yes
