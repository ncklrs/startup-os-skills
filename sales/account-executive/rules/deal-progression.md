## Deal Progression and Momentum

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Deals don't close themselves. Every day without progress is a day closer to loss. Elite AEs control the process — they don't wait for customers to drive timing.

### The Momentum Equation

```
Momentum = (Champion Engagement x Stakeholder Alignment x Urgency) / Time

High momentum: Multiple stakeholders engaged, clear timeline, regular progress
Low momentum: Single contact, vague timeline, gaps between interactions
```

### Mutual Action Plans (MAPs)

**The #1 tool for deal control.**

A MAP is a shared document that outlines every step from current state to close. Both sides commit to it.

**MAP Template:**

| Date | Action | Owner | Status |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| Week 1 | Discovery call complete | Both | Done |
| Week 2 | Technical requirements documented | Customer | Done |
| Week 3 | Technical deep-dive with IT | Vendor | Scheduled |
| Week 4 | ROI analysis reviewed | Both | Pending |
| Week 5 | Executive business case presentation | Vendor | |
| Week 6 | Proposal delivery | Vendor | |
| Week 7 | Legal/security review | Customer | |
| Week 8 | Contract signed | Both | |

**Introducing the MAP:**

```
"Sarah, I want to make sure we're aligned on the path forward
and there are no surprises for either of us. I've put together
a simple mutual action plan that outlines the key milestones
between now and your target go-live date.

Can we review this together and adjust based on your internal
process? I want to make sure this reflects reality, not wishful
thinking on my part."
```

### Stage Exit Criteria

**Don't advance deals without meeting exit criteria:**

| Stage | Exit Criteria | Verification |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **Discovery → Scoping** | Pain quantified, champion identified, budget range confirmed, timeline clear | Champion confirms verbally |
| **Scoping → Validation** | Requirements documented, success criteria defined, technical team engaged | Signed off by stakeholders |
| **Validation → Proposal** | Technical validation complete, EB engaged, ROI accepted, competition understood | EB confirms path to decision |
| **Proposal → Closing** | Pricing agreed, terms negotiated, procurement engaged, legal review started | Written commitment to process |

### Maintaining Momentum

**The 48-Hour Rule:**
Never let 48 hours pass without customer interaction or clear next step.

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Meeting completed | Send summary + next steps within 4 hours |
| Next meeting scheduled | Confirm agenda 24 hours before |
| Waiting on customer | Follow up at 48 hours with value-add |
| Deal stalling | Direct conversation about blockers |

**Creating Momentum:**

```
"Sarah, I noticed we've been quiet for a few days. I want to
make sure we're on track for your Q1 implementation goal.

To hit that date, we'd need to complete technical validation
by [date] and have contracts in legal by [date]. Are we still
on track, or has something changed I should know about?"
```

### Compelling Events

**Artificial urgency fails. Real urgency closes deals.**

| Type | Example | Effectiveness |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Customer-driven** | Contract renewal, audit deadline, product launch | Highest |
| **Market-driven** | Competitive pressure, regulation change | High |
| **Budget-driven** | Use-it-or-lose-it budget, fiscal year end | Medium-High |
| **Vendor-driven** | Price increase, promotion ending | Low (usually) |

**Finding compelling events:**

```
"Help me understand the timing. You mentioned wanting to solve
this in Q1 — what's driving that? Is there a specific initiative
or deadline that makes Q1 important?"

[If vague] "What happens if this doesn't get implemented until
Q2 or Q3? What's the cost of waiting?"
```

### The Stalled Deal Playbook

**Diagnose first:**

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Champion goes dark | Lost confidence or facing internal resistance | Direct conversation, offer help |
| "Waiting on..." | Lower priority than stated | Re-establish urgency or deprioritize |
| New stakeholders appear | Process not understood | Map the process, engage new players |
| Endless questions | Technical buyer blocking | Address concerns directly, escalate |
| "Let's revisit next quarter" | Not a priority | Qualify out or find compelling event |

**The Re-engagement Sequence:**

```
Day 1: Value-add email
"Sarah, thought you'd find this relevant — [industry insight,
relevant content, or customer story]."

Day 4: Direct question
"Sarah, I want to be direct. We were making good progress toward
your Q1 goal, and I haven't heard back. Has something changed
I should know about? Happy to adjust our approach."

Day 8: Executive outreach (if warranted)
"[EB name], I've been working with Sarah on [initiative]. We
identified $X in potential impact, but momentum has stalled.
I'd value understanding if priorities have shifted or if there's
something I can do differently to support your team."

Day 12: The honest assessment
"Sarah, I want to respect your time and mine. Based on our
recent conversations, it seems like timing may not be right
for this initiative. Is that accurate? If so, no problem —
I'd rather know than keep following up."
```

### Progress Indicators

**Green flags (deal moving forward):**

- Next meeting scheduled before current meeting ends
- Customer introduces you to new stakeholders
- Customer shares internal documents or timelines
- Technical team asks implementation questions
- Procurement timeline confirmed
- Champion proactively updates you
- Reference calls requested

**Red flags (deal stalling):**

- "Let me get back to you" without date
- Meetings rescheduled multiple times
- Can't get beyond single contact
- Vague answers to timeline questions
- Competitor mentioned unexpectedly
- Budget concerns raised after scoping
- Silence after proposal sent

### Deal Acceleration Tactics

| Tactic | When to Use | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Executive sponsor engagement** | Deal stuck at mid-level | CRO-to-CRO conversation |
| **Proof of value / pilot** | Technical concerns | Limited deployment to prove results |
| **Reference call** | Trust gap | Connect with peer customer |
| **Business case workshop** | ROI unclear | Collaborative value modeling |
| **Site visit** | Strategic deal, need differentiation | In-person relationship building |
| **Competitive intel** | Competitor gaining ground | Strategic differentiation |

### The Weekly Deal Review

For every active opportunity, answer:

1. What concrete progress was made this week?
2. What is the specific next step and date?
3. Who are we meeting with next?
4. What could derail this deal?
5. What do we need from the customer by when?
6. Are we on track for the forecasted close date?

**If you can't answer these, you don't control the deal.**

### Anti-Patterns

- **Hope as a strategy** — "I think they're interested"
- **Single path to close** — No plan B if timeline slips
- **Vendor-driven urgency only** — "Our quarter ends Friday!"
- **Disappearing between stages** — Long gaps kill momentum
- **Avoiding bad news** — Not asking hard questions
- **Over-proposing** — Sending proposal before earning it
- **Under-following-up** — Fear of being "annoying"
