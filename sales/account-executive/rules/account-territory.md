## Territory and Time Management

**Impact: HIGH**

You have 2,000 hours per year and a territory of accounts to cover. How you allocate those hours determines whether you hit quota. Elite AEs treat time as their scarcest resource.

### The Territory Math

```
Working Hours Per Year
- 52 weeks x 40 hours = 2,080 hours
- Minus: PTO, holidays, training, admin = -400 hours
- Available selling hours: ~1,680 hours

If Quota = $1M, Each Hour Must Generate:
$1M / 1,680 hours = $595/hour

A meeting with a $25K opportunity (25% win rate) = $6,250 value
1-hour meeting = $6,250 potential value
10 hours on a deal that should've been disqualified = $6,250 wasted
```

### Account Tiering Strategy

**Tier your territory ruthlessly:**

| Tier | Criteria | Time Allocation | Activity Level |
|------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | $100K+ potential, active buying signals, strategic fit | 40% | White-glove, weekly touch |
| **Tier 2** | $50-100K potential, good fit, developing need | 35% | High-touch, bi-weekly |
| **Tier 3** | $25-50K potential, decent fit, longer timeline | 20% | Efficient, monthly |
| **Tier 4** | <$25K or poor fit | 5% | Automated, or SDR/BDR |

### Ideal Week Structure

**Time-blocking for maximum effectiveness:**

```
MONDAY
7:00-8:00   Planning, CRM updates, pipeline review
8:00-12:00  External meetings (customer calls)
12:00-1:00  Admin, follow-ups

5:00-6:00   Email, next-day prep

TUESDAY

8:00-12:00  External meetings
12:00-1:00  Internal meeting (forecast, team)
1:00-5:00   External meetings
5:00-6:00   Proposal work

```

### Time Audit: Where Does Your Time Go?

Track for one week:

| Activity | Target | Actual | Adjust |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Customer meetings** | 25+ hours | ? | |
| **Prospecting** | 5-10 hours | ? | |
| **Internal meetings** | <5 hours | ? | |
| **Admin/CRM** | <5 hours | ? | |
| **Email** | <5 hours | ? | |
| **Proposal/prep work** | 5-10 hours | ? | |

**Most AEs find:**
- Too much internal meeting time
- Too little prospecting
- Too much email/admin
- Inefficient prep before customer calls

### The 80/20 of Sales Activities

**High-value activities (do more):**
- Customer meetings with decision-makers
- Champion enablement conversations
- Prospecting to ideal accounts
- Proposal presentations
- Negotiation discussions

**Low-value activities (do less):**
- Email chains that should be calls
- CRM data entry beyond requirements
- Internal meetings without purpose
- Unqualified demo requests
- Proposal customization for weak deals

### Meeting Efficiency

**Before every meeting, ask:**

1. Is this meeting necessary? (Could it be an email?)
2. Do I have a clear objective?
3. Who needs to be there? (Fewer is usually better)
4. How long does it really need to be? (25 or 50 min, not 30 or 60)
5. What's the next step I want to leave with?

**Meeting Types and Optimal Length:**

| Meeting Type | Recommended Length | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Discovery call | 30 minutes | Focused questions |
| Demo | 45 minutes | Leave time for discussion |
| Technical deep-dive | 60 minutes | With technical team |
| Executive briefing | 20-30 minutes | Executives are busy |
| Proposal review | 30-45 minutes | Focus on decision |
| Negotiation | 30-45 minutes | Keep it moving |

### Batching and Blocking

**Batch similar activities:**

| Activity Type | Optimal Batch | When |
|---------------|---------------|------|
| Prospecting calls | 2-3 hour blocks | Morning, energy high |
| Email responses | 30 min blocks, 2x/day | After meetings |
| CRM updates | 30 min, end of day | Daily habit |
| Proposal writing | 2-hour blocks | Quiet time |
| Admin tasks | 1 hour, weekly | Friday afternoon |

**Protect your blocks:**

```
"I have a hard stop at 4pm for another commitment"
(The commitment is your prospecting block)

"I keep mornings for customer calls — can we do Thursday afternoon?"
(Protecting external meeting time)
```

### Prioritization Framework

**Daily prioritization:**

```
MUST DO (non-negotiable)
1. [Critical customer follow-up]
2. [Proposal deadline]
3. [Scheduled customer meetings]

SHOULD DO (high impact)
1. [Prospecting block]
2. [Champion check-in]
3. [CRM pipeline updates]

COULD DO (if time allows)
1. [Industry research]
2. [Internal project]
3. [Training]
```

### Travel Optimization

**For field territories:**

| Travel Metric | Target | Why |
|---------------|--------|-----|
| Meetings per trip | 4-6 | ROI on travel time |
| Travel days per month | <8 | Balance with productivity |
| Same-city grouping | 80%+ | Reduce windshield time |
| Flight vs. drive decision | <3 hours | Time is money |

**Trip planning template:**

```
CITY: [Location]
DATES: [Travel dates]

MEETINGS SCHEDULED:
1. [Company A] - [Time] - [Location] - [Purpose]
2. [Company B] - [Time] - [Location] - [Purpose]
3. [Company C] - [Time] - [Location] - [Purpose]

PROSPECTING TARGETS (fill gaps):
1. [Company D] - attempting to schedule
2. [Company E] - attempting to schedule

LOGISTICS:
- Flight: [Details]
- Hotel: [Details]
- Dinner with [Customer]: [Details]
```

### Energy Management

**Sales is a performance sport. Manage energy, not just time.**

| Energy State | Best Activities | Avoid |
|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Peak energy** (morning for most) | Prospecting, difficult conversations, creative work | Admin, email |
| **Moderate energy** (midday) | Customer meetings, collaboration | Deep work |
| **Low energy** (afternoon slump) | Admin, CRM, low-stakes follow-ups | Important calls |
| **Recovery** (end of day) | Planning, reflection | Nothing new |

### Saying No

**Protect your time ruthlessly:**

```
"I appreciate you thinking of me for [request], but I need to
prioritize my customer commitments this week. Can we revisit
next week?"

"That sounds like a great opportunity, but it doesn't align
with my current territory focus. You might try [colleague]."

"I can do a 15-minute call or answer via email — which works
better? I'm protecting time for customer meetings this week."
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Inbox slavery** — Checking email constantly
- **Meeting sprawl** — Hour-long calls for 15-min topics
- **Windshield time** — Inefficient travel routing
- **Equal time allocation** — Same effort for all accounts
- **Reactive calendar** — Others control your time
- **Low-value prospecting** — Reaching out to everyone
- **Admin perfectionism** — Over-polished CRM entries
- **Saying yes to everything** — Being helpful vs. being effective
