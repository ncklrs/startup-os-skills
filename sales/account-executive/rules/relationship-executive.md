## Executive Engagement Strategies

**Impact: CRITICAL**

If you can't get to the Economic Buyer, you can't close the deal. Executives think differently, have different priorities, and require a different approach than your day-to-day contacts.

### Why Executive Access Matters

| With EB Access | Without EB Access |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Shorter sales cycles | Deals stall at approval |
| Larger deal sizes | Scope stays limited |
| Higher win rates | Champion carries too much |
| Faster expansion | Renewal battles |
| Real feedback | Filtered information |

### The Executive Mindset

**What executives care about:**

| Priority | Questions They Ask | What They Don't Care About |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Strategic outcomes** | "How does this impact our goals?" | Feature lists |
| **Risk mitigation** | "What could go wrong?" | Technical architecture |
| **Time to value** | "When do we see results?" | Implementation details |
| **Competitive advantage** | "Does this differentiate us?" | Vendor comparisons |
| **Resource allocation** | "What's the true cost?" | Per-seat pricing |
| **Credibility** | "Who else has done this?" | Demo environments |

### Earning the Right to Executive Time

**You must bring:**

1. **Insight they don't have**
   - Industry trends, benchmarks, peer practices
   - "Companies like yours are approaching this differently..."

2. **Access they can't get elsewhere**
   - Peer executive connections
   - "Would a conversation with [peer executive at customer] be valuable?"

3. **Preparation that respects their time**
   - Researched their priorities, their earnings calls, their LinkedIn posts
   - "I noticed you mentioned X at the last earnings call..."

4. **A compelling reason to meet NOW**
   - Tied to their current initiatives or pain
   - "Given your announced initiative around Y, there may be an opportunity..."

### Requesting Executive Meetings

**Through your champion (preferred):**

```
"Sarah, we've built a strong business case that shows $2M in
potential impact. For a decision of this magnitude, I'd expect
[EB name] to want input. Could you help me understand the best
way to get on their calendar?

I'm not asking for an hour-long sales pitch — I'd like 15 minutes
to understand their priorities directly, so our proposal addresses
what matters most to them. What would make them say yes to that?"
```

**Direct outreach (when necessary):**

```
Subject: [Specific insight] for [Company] — via [champion name]

[EB name],

I've been working with [champion] on [specific initiative].
We've identified a potential $[X] impact to [metric they care about].

Before finalizing our recommendations, I'd value 15 minutes to
understand your priorities for [relevant area] this year.

[Champion] mentioned you're particularly focused on [priority
from research]. I have some insights from working with [peer
companies] that might be relevant.

Would [specific times] work for a brief call?

[Your name]
```

### The Executive Meeting Framework

**Before the meeting (15 min prep):**

| Research | Source |
|----------|--------|
| Company priorities | Earnings calls, annual reports, press releases |
| Executive background | LinkedIn, interviews, speaking engagements |
| Industry challenges | Analyst reports, news |
| Competitive landscape | Public information, champion intel |

**Meeting structure (30 minutes):**

```
[0-5 min] RAPPORT & CONTEXT
"Thank you for your time. [Champion] has shared context, but
I'd love to hear directly — what's your top priority for
[their function] this year?"

[5-15 min] LISTEN & PROBE
Ask about their challenges, not your solution.
"What's making that difficult?"
"What have you tried?"
"What would success look like?"

[15-25 min] SHARE PERSPECTIVE
Connect their priorities to your value.
"Based on what you've shared, here's what we've seen work..."
Share relevant proof points and outcomes.

[25-30 min] ALIGN ON NEXT STEPS
"It sounds like [summary of their priorities]. The next step
from my side would be [specific action]. What would you need
to see to feel confident moving forward?"
```

### Executive Communication Principles

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Lead with outcomes, not features | Start with product overview |
| Use their language and metrics | Use vendor jargon |
| Share peer benchmarks | Talk about your company |
| Be concise (they'll ask for more) | Over-explain |
| Acknowledge risks proactively | Avoid difficult topics |
| Have a clear ask | End without next step |
| Follow up in writing | Assume they'll remember |

### Executive Objection Handling

**"I don't have time for this"**
```
"Completely understand. I wouldn't ask for your time unless
there was material impact. [Champion] has identified $[X] in
potential value. Would a 15-minute call to validate that be
worthwhile, or should I proceed with the team and bring you
in at the decision point?"
```

**"My team handles vendor decisions"**
```
"Absolutely, and I'm working closely with [team]. Given the
strategic nature of this — [specific impact] — I wanted to
ensure our proposal aligns with your priorities. Many executives
prefer to be involved earlier rather than surprised later.
Would a 15-minute briefing before the proposal be valuable?"
```

**"Send me something to review"**
```
"Happy to. To make sure I send the right information, could you
share what would be most useful? A high-level executive summary,
the detailed business case [champion] and I developed, or
something else?"
```

### The Executive Sponsor Strategy

For strategic deals, consider executive sponsor involvement:

| Your Executive | Their Executive | Purpose |
|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| CEO/CRO | CEO/C-Suite | Strategic partnership |
| VP Sales | VP-level buyer | Peer relationship |
| CSM Manager | VP Ops | Success partnership |

**Executive Sponsor Engagement:**

```
"[Champion], for strategic partnerships of this size, our
leadership typically engages directly with yours. Would it be
valuable for our [title] to meet with [their executive]?

The focus would be strategic alignment — understanding their
long-term vision and ensuring we're set up to support it. Not
a sales call, but a partnership conversation."
```

### Executive Engagement Across the Cycle

| Stage | Executive Engagement | Purpose |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| **Discovery** | Research only | Understand priorities |
| **Scoping** | Brief intro (optional) | Validate strategic fit |
| **Validation** | Formal meeting | Present business case |
| **Proposal** | Alignment call | Confirm commitment |
| **Closing** | Sign-off conversation | Remove final blockers |

### Post-Meeting Execution

**Same-day follow-up:**

```
Subject: Follow-up — [topic discussed]

[EB name],

Thank you for your time today. Key takeaways from our conversation:

1. Your top priority is [what they said]
2. The key challenge is [what they said]
3. Success looks like [what they said]

Based on this, our next steps are:
- [Champion] and I will finalize the business case with [specific metric]
- I'll coordinate with [technical contact] on [specific item]
- We'll plan to reconnect on [date] to present recommendations

Please let me know if I've captured this correctly.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Avoiding executives** — "My champion will handle it"
- **Pitching to executives** — Feature dumps kill deals
- **Unprepared meetings** — Wasting their time destroys credibility
- **Going around champions** — Damages trust, backfires
- **No clear ask** — Meeting without purpose
- **One-and-done** — Single executive touch isn't enough
- **Wrong level** — Meeting with "executives" who can't decide
