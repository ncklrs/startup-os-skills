## Account Expansion and Land-Expand Strategy

**Impact: HIGH**

The best new pipeline lives in your existing customers. Land-and-expand isn't just a motion — it's a mindset that sees every closed deal as the beginning, not the end.

### The Expansion Math

```
Acquiring a new customer: $X
Expanding an existing customer: $X/5 (80% lower cost)

New customer win rate: 20-25%
Expansion win rate: 60-70%

New customer cycle: 90 days
Expansion cycle: 30-45 days
```

**Net Revenue Retention (NRR) drives valuation:**
- <100%: Leaky bucket (bad)
- 100-110%: Stable (okay)
- 110-130%: Growth engine (good)
- 130%+: Exceptional (best SaaS companies)

### Land-and-Expand Framework

│  Initial deal: Solve ONE problem for ONE team                        │
│  Size: $25-50K (digestible, low risk)                                │

### The Expansion Map

For every customer, map the expansion opportunity:

| Dimension | Current State | Expansion Potential | Strategy |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Users** | 50 seats | 500 potential users | Prove value, drive adoption |
| **Use cases** | Use case A | B, C, D possible | Roadmap discussions |
| **Teams** | Marketing team | Sales, CS, Product | Cross-department intro |
| **Products** | Core platform | Add-ons X, Y, Z | Feature awareness |
| **Regions** | US only | EMEA, APAC | Regional expansion |

### Timing Expansion Conversations

**Expansion triggers:**

| Trigger | Signal | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Usage milestone** | 80%+ adoption, heavy usage | Discuss capacity expansion |
| **Success milestone** | Achieved stated outcomes | Reference success, explore more |
| **Budget cycle** | Q4 planning, fiscal year start | Include expansion in budget |
| **Champion event** | Champion promoted, new role | Leverage expanded influence |
| **Organizational change** | Reorg, new exec, acquisition | Map new stakeholders |
| **Product launch** | Your new feature, their new initiative | Connect the dots |

### The Land Conversation

**Positioning for future expansion at the initial close:**

```
"Sarah, I'm excited to partner on this initiative. As we
implement, I want to be transparent about how other customers
have grown with us:

We'll start with the Marketing team and the use case we discussed.
Once you see results — typically around month 3 — customers like
[reference] found opportunities to extend to Sales and Customer
Success.

I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but I'd love to schedule
a 90-day review to assess results and explore what's next.
Does that make sense?"
```

### The Expansion Discovery

**Don't assume you know the opportunity:**

```
"Sarah, it's been 6 months since go-live, and your team has
seen impressive results with [specific metrics]. I'd love to
understand what's next on your radar.

What other challenges are you facing that we should explore?
Are there other teams experiencing similar pain?
What initiatives are on the roadmap for next year?"
```

### Expansion Playbooks by Type

**Seat Expansion:**

```
Trigger: Approaching license cap
Motion: Usage review, business case for more seats
Message: "Your team has hit 90% of licenses. Based on usage
patterns, [X] additional users could benefit. Let me show you
the value per user your team is getting..."
```

**Product/Feature Expansion:**

```
Trigger: New product launch, underutilized features
Motion: Feature training, pilot proposal
Message: "Based on your success with [current use], customers
in your situation typically see 40% more value with [new feature].
Shall I walk you through how [similar customer] implemented it?"
```

**Horizontal Expansion (new teams):**

```
Trigger: Success metrics, champion influence
Motion: Cross-department introduction, business case
Message: "The results your team achieved — [specific metrics] —
would likely resonate with [other team]. Would you be open to
introducing me? I'd position it as sharing best practices, not
a sales call."
```

**Vertical Expansion (new executives):**

```
Trigger: Champion promotion, strategic initiative
Motion: Executive briefing, platform discussion
Message: "Congratulations on the VP role. Given your expanded
scope, I'd love to understand your priorities and explore how
we might support your broader vision."
```

### The QBR (Quarterly Business Review)

The QBR is your expansion engine.

**QBR Agenda:**

```
1. VALUE DELIVERED (15 min)
   - Metrics achieved vs. goals
   - ROI calculation
   - Success stories from their team

2. ADOPTION AND USAGE (10 min)
   - Usage trends
   - Training needs
   - Support tickets and resolution

3. ROADMAP ALIGNMENT (10 min)
   - Your upcoming features
   - Their upcoming initiatives
   - Connection points

4. EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES (15 min)
   - New use cases to explore
   - Teams that could benefit
   - Budget timing and process

5. ACTION ITEMS (10 min)
   - Clear next steps
   - Owners and dates
```

### Champion as Expansion Agent

Your initial champion is key to expansion — but you may need new champions for new teams.

**Enabling expansion champions:**

```
"Sarah, you've been a phenomenal partner, and your team's success
is well-known internally. I've heard [other VP name] is facing
similar challenges.

Would you be comfortable sharing your experience with them? I'm
not asking you to sell — just to share what worked for your team.
I can provide talking points and the ROI summary if helpful."
```

### Expansion Forecasting

Track expansion pipeline separately:

| Category | Definition | Weight in Forecast |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Committed expansion** | PO expected, budget approved | 90% |
| **Upside expansion** | Champion engaged, budget identified | 50% |
| **Pipeline expansion** | Opportunity identified, discovery complete | 25% |
| **Potential expansion** | Whitespace mapped, not yet engaged | Track only |

### The Account Plan

For strategic accounts, maintain an account plan:

```
ACCOUNT: [Company]
AE: [Name]
CSM: [Name]

CURRENT STATE
- Annual contract value: $X
- Products owned: [List]
- Teams using: [List]
- Key contacts: [List]
- Health score: [Green/Yellow/Red]

EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES
1. [Opportunity 1]: $X potential, [timeline], [owner]
2. [Opportunity 2]: $X potential, [timeline], [owner]
3. [Opportunity 3]: $X potential, [timeline], [owner]

90-DAY PRIORITIES
1. [Priority 1]
2. [Priority 2]
3. [Priority 3]

RISKS AND BLOCKERS
- [Risk 1]: Mitigation plan
- [Risk 2]: Mitigation plan
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Close and forget** — Moving on without ensuring success
- **Transactional relationships** — Not building multi-year partnerships
- **Single-threaded accounts** — Champion leaves, account churns
- **Missing QBRs** — No regular strategic touchpoint
- **Assuming you know the opportunity** — Not re-discovering
- **Expansion without adoption** — Selling more before proving value
- **Ignoring small accounts** — They grow into big accounts
