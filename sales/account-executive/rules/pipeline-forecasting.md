## Pipeline Forecasting and CRM Discipline

**Impact: HIGH**

Your forecast is your credibility. Accurate forecasting builds trust with leadership, enables proper resource planning, and separates professionals from amateurs. CRM discipline is the foundation.

### Why Forecasting Matters

| Stakeholder | What They Need | Why |
|-------------|----------------|-----|
| **Sales leadership** | Revenue predictability | Resource planning, board reporting |
| **Finance** | Cash flow visibility | Budget planning, investor relations |
| **Customer success** | Onboarding forecast | Staffing, capacity planning |
| **You** | Self-awareness | Performance improvement |

### Forecast Categories

| Category | Definition | Probability | Criteria |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Closed Won** | Contract signed, revenue booked | 100% | Executed agreement |
| **Commit** | Will close this period, high confidence | 90%+ | EB engaged, terms agreed, contract in legal |
| **Best Case** | Could close this period with momentum | 60-80% | EB met, proposal delivered, positive signals |
| **Pipeline** | Active opportunity, unlikely this period | 25-50% | Discovery complete, champion engaged |
| **Upside** | Early stage, possible acceleration | 10-25% | Qualified but timeline unclear |

### Commit Criteria Checklist

**Only commit a deal when you can say "yes" to ALL:**

| Criteria | Question | Y/N |
|----------|----------|-----|
| **Economic Buyer engaged** | Have you met the person who signs the check? | |
| **Terms agreed** | Is there mutual agreement on price and scope? | |
| **Paper process known** | Do you know every step between now and signature? | |
| **Timeline confirmed** | Has the customer committed to a close date? | |
| **No competing priorities** | Is anything likely to delay this? | |
| **Champion confident** | Does your champion believe this will close? | |
| **You've been told yes** | Have they explicitly said they're moving forward? | |

**If any answer is "No," it's not a commit — it's best case.**

### The Forecast Call Framework

Weekly forecast review structure:

```
1. COMMITS REVIEW
   - What's changed since last week?
   - What specific actions close these deals?
   - What could prevent close?

2. BEST CASE REVIEW
   - What's needed to convert to commit?
   - What's the realistic close date?
   - What's blocking progress?

3. PIPELINE HEALTH
   - New opportunities added
   - Deals pushed or lost
   - Coverage ratio check

4. NEXT WEEK ACTIONS
   - Key meetings scheduled
   - Commitments to move deals
   - Support needed
```

### Pipeline Metrics to Track

| Metric | Formula | Target Range | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Pipeline coverage** | Pipeline / Quota | 3-4x | Enough at-bats to hit quota |
| **Win rate** | Won / (Won + Lost) | 20-30% | Deal quality and execution |
| **Average deal size** | Revenue / Deals | Varies | Efficiency and strategy |
| **Sales cycle length** | Days discovery to close | Industry varies | Forecasting accuracy |
| **Stage conversion** | % advancing each stage | 30-50% | Identifies process gaps |
| **Forecast accuracy** | Committed vs. Closed | 80%+ | Credibility |

### Pipeline Coverage by Stage

**Healthy pipeline distribution:**

```
Your $1M quota needs $3-4M coverage

Stage Distribution:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Discovery (10%)     │████████████████████│  40%  │ $1.6M │
│ Scoping (25%)       │██████████████│      │  25%  │ $1.0M │
│ Validation (50%)    │████████████│        │  20%  │ $0.8M │
│ Proposal (75%)      │████████│            │  10%  │ $0.4M │
│ Closing (90%)       │████│                │   5%  │ $0.2M │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Total Pipeline: $4.0M (4x coverage)
```

### CRM Hygiene Standards

**Minimum data requirements per opportunity:**

| Field | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **Close date** | Forecasting | Every interaction |
| **Amount** | Coverage calculation | When scope changes |
| **Stage** | Pipeline visibility | When criteria met |
| **Next step** | Accountability | After every touch |
| **Champion** | Deal health | When identified/changes |
| **Competitor** | Strategy | When discovered |
| **Pain/value** | Deal rationale | At discovery |
| **Last activity** | Engagement tracking | Automatic |

### Deal Inspection Questions

For every deal in your forecast, be able to answer:

**Qualification:**
- Why will they buy anything?
- Why will they buy from us?
- Why will they buy now?
- Why will they buy at this price?

**Process:**
- What is the specific next step and date?
- Who is the economic buyer and have you met them?
- What is the paper process and timeline?
- What could prevent this from closing?

**Competition:**
- Who else are they evaluating?
- What's our differentiation?
- Why would they choose us over alternatives?

### Common Forecasting Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality | How to Avoid |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Happy ears** | Customer politeness ≠ commitment | Ask direct closing questions |
| **Champion inflation** | Champion enthusiasm ≠ EB approval | Verify with EB directly |
| **Ignore competition** | Unknown competitor is still a threat | Always ask about alternatives |
| **Close date optimism** | Customer timelines slip | Build in buffer |
| **Sunk cost commitment** | Time invested ≠ deal quality | Evaluate objectively |
| **End-of-quarter push** | Customer doesn't care about your quarter | Find their urgency |

### Updating Your Forecast

**When to update:**

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| After every customer meeting | Update close date, stage, next step |
| New stakeholder identified | Add contact, note influence |
| Competitor mentioned | Update competitor field |
| Budget confirmed/changed | Update amount |
| Timeline shifted | Update close date with notes |
| Deal at risk | Flag and document risk |
| Deal won/lost | Update stage, log reason |

**How to communicate changes:**

```
"Pushing [Company] from commit to best case.

What changed: Procurement process is longer than champion
indicated. Security review just started, typically 3 weeks.

New expected close: End of next month.

Action plan: Scheduled security call for Thursday, sending
compliance docs today."
```

### Weekly Pipeline Review Cadence

| Day | Activity | Time |
|-----|----------|------|
| **Monday AM** | Update all opportunities from weekend | 30 min |
| **Monday PM** | Forecast submission | 15 min |
| **Wednesday** | Mid-week checkpoint on commits | 15 min |
| **Thursday** | 1:1 with manager, deal review | 30 min |
| **Friday** | Week close-out, plan next week | 30 min |

### Building Forecast Credibility

**Trust is earned through consistency:**

```
Month 1: Commit $100K, closed $85K (85% accuracy)
Month 2: Commit $120K, closed $110K (92% accuracy)
Month 3: Commit $150K, closed $145K (97% accuracy)

Result: Leadership trusts your forecast, you earn autonomy
```

**When you miss:**

```
"I committed [deal] that didn't close. Here's what happened:
[honest assessment]. What I'm doing differently: [specific action]."
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Sandbagging** — Hiding deals to look good later
- **Stuffing** — Over-committing to look aggressive
- **Stale pipeline** — Opportunities that haven't been updated
- **Stage inflation** — Advancing without meeting criteria
- **Close date fiction** — End of month for everything
- **CRM avoidance** — Keeping the real data in your head
- **Last-minute commits** — Adding deals day of forecast
- **Blame shifting** — Customer's fault, not qualification
