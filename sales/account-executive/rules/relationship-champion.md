## Champion Development and Enablement

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Your champion sells when you're not in the room. They navigate politics, overcome objections, and build consensus. A weak champion means a lost deal. An enabled champion is your unfair advantage.

### What Makes a True Champion

**Champion vs. Contact:**

| Champion | Contact |
|----------|---------|
| Actively sells internally for you | Receives information from you |
| Has political capital to spend | Has title but no influence |
| Shares internal information | Shares only what's asked |
| Tells you bad news early | Surprises you with problems |
| Introduces you to power | Blocks access to protect status |
| Has personal stake in success | Has professional curiosity |

### The Champion Criteria (CHESS)

| Criteria | Question | Red Flag |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **C**redibility | Do others respect their judgment? | Junior role, new to company |
| **H**unger | Do they personally need this to succeed? | "Nice to have" attitude |
| **E**ngagement | Do they proactively drive momentum? | Passive, waits for you |
| **S**avvy | Can they navigate internal politics? | Doesn't understand org dynamics |
| **S**ponsorship | Do they have executive backing? | Isolated from leadership |

### Finding Your Champion

**Discovery questions that reveal champions:**

```
"Who else in the organization is feeling this pain acutely?"

"If this project gets funded, who would be responsible for
making it successful?"

"Who in leadership is most likely to champion a project like this?"

"Who successfully got a similar initiative approved in the past?"

"If you were building a task force for this, who would you want
on it?"
```

```

### Coaching Champions to Sell Internally

**The Message Framework:**

Help champions articulate:

1. **The Problem** (Why now?)
```
"We're losing $X per quarter because of [specific pain].
This directly impacts [strategic priority]."
```

2. **The Solution** (Why this?)
```
"[Vendor] addresses this by [capability]. Companies like
[reference] have seen [specific outcome]."
```

3. **The Ask** (What next?)
```
"I recommend we proceed to [next step]. This requires
[time/budget/approval] from [who]."
```

### Role-Playing Scenarios

Prepare champions for tough conversations:

**Scenario 1: Budget Objection**
```
Coach: "Your CFO asks 'Why can't we just build this ourselves?'"

Champion Response: "We explored that. Internal build would take
8+ months and 2 FTEs. At our fully-loaded cost of $150K/engineer,
that's $300K plus opportunity cost. [Vendor] delivers in 6 weeks
for $120K annual."
```

**Scenario 2: Competitor Mention**
```
Coach: "CTO says 'Shouldn't we look at [Competitor] too?'"

Champion Response: "We evaluated them. Three key differences:
[differentiator 1], [differentiator 2], and [differentiator 3].
Based on our specific requirements, [Vendor] is the stronger fit.
Happy to share the detailed comparison."
```

**Scenario 3: Timing Pushback**
```
Coach: "VP says 'Let's revisit this next quarter.'"

Champion Response: "I understand we have competing priorities.
However, every month we delay costs us $X in [specific impact].
Over Q1, that's $Y we can't recover. The 30-minute eval meeting
is a small investment to confirm whether this should be prioritized."
```

### Champion Communication Cadence

| Deal Stage | Check-in Frequency | Purpose |
|------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Discovery** | Weekly | Gather intel, test champion strength |
| **Scoping** | 2x/week | Co-develop requirements, enable selling |
| **Validation** | 2-3x/week | Prepare for EB, handle objections |
| **Proposal** | Daily | Navigate procurement, close |
| **Closing** | As needed | Remove final blockers |

### Warning Signs: Champion Slipping

| Signal | What It Means | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Responses slow down | Losing interest or facing resistance | Direct conversation, find new thread |
| Hedging language | "Maybe," "We'll see," "Hopefully" | Qualify out or address concerns |
| Stops sharing intel | Lost trust or confidence | Rebuild relationship |
| Defers all decisions | Not really a champion | Find true champion |
| Avoids executive intro | Afraid to spend political capital | Coach or pivot |

**The Direct Conversation:**
```
"Sarah, I've noticed our momentum has slowed. I want to be direct
with you — is there something happening internally I should know
about? My goal is to help you succeed, and I can only do that if
I understand what you're facing."
```

### Champion Relationship Post-Sale

**Champions become:**
- Reference customers
- Expansion champions (new use cases)
- Referral sources
- Executive sponsors for renewals
- Future customers at new companies

**Maintain the relationship:**
- Quarterly check-ins minimum
- Share relevant content/insights
- Include in customer advisory boards
- Recognize their success publicly
- Track them if they change jobs

### Anti-Patterns

- **Accepting weak champions** — Title without influence
- **Under-enabling** — Expecting them to figure it out
- **Over-reliance** — Not building other threads
- **Ignoring champion's goals** — What's in it for them?
- **Burning champions** — Making them look bad internally
- **Abandoning post-sale** — Forgetting them after close
- **One champion fits all** — Different deals need different champions
