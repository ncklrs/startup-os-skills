## Note-Taking and CRM Documentation

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Great discovery is wasted if it's not documented. Your notes are the foundation for demos, proposals, negotiations, and handoffs.

### Why Documentation Matters

```
DOCUMENTED DISCOVERY:           UNDOCUMENTED DISCOVERY:
- Personalized demos            - Generic presentations
- Accurate proposals            - Guessed pricing
- Smooth handoffs               - Re-discovery needed
- Deal continuity               - Lost context
- Forecasting accuracy          - Pipeline surprises
```

### Real-Time Note-Taking

**What to capture during the call:**
- Direct quotes (exact words)
- Numbers and metrics
- Names and roles mentioned
- Pain points with specifics
- Decision process details
- Timeline drivers
- Competition mentioned
- Objections raised
- Commitment level

**Note-taking techniques:**
```
1. Split screen: Video + notes side by side
2. Use shorthand: P = Pain, C = Competition, Q = Quote
3. Capture quotes verbatim: Use quotation marks
4. Timestamp key moments: "23:00 - revealed budget"
5. Star (*) action items
6. Question mark (?) things to clarify
```

### CRM Field Requirements

**Essential fields to update after every call:**

| Field | What to Enter | Why It Matters |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Stage** | Current sales stage | Pipeline accuracy |
| **Next Step** | Specific action + date | Deal momentum |
| **Close Date** | Best estimate | Forecast accuracy |
| **Amount** | Deal value | Revenue forecast |
| **Champion** | Name + contact | Key relationship |
| **Competition** | Who else they're evaluating | Strategy |
| **Pain Points** | Top 3 summarized | Demo/proposal prep |
| **Decision Criteria** | What matters most | Positioning |
| **Compelling Event** | What's driving timeline | Urgency |

### CRM Entry Best Practices

**Good CRM entry:**
```
CALL SUMMARY:
Discovery with Mike Rodriguez (DevOps Lead) - 45 min

KEY FINDINGS:
- Managing secrets manually, costs 40 hrs/month (~$6K)
- SOC 2 audit in March driving urgency
- Also evaluating HashiCorp Vault (had one demo)
- Budget allocated: $30-50K/year
- Decision maker: Sarah Chen (VP Eng) - need to meet

PAIN QUOTES:
- "It's a nightmare every time someone leaves"
- "I can't sleep before an audit"

NEXT STEPS:
- Demo scheduled 1/22 with Mike + Security Lead
- Mike to request intro to Sarah for exec briefing
- Sent case study from similar fintech

DEAL NOTES:
Strong opportunity - clear pain, budget, timeline. Need to
multi-thread to VP level before proposal. Main risk:
HashiCorp relationship with Security team.
```

**Bad CRM entry:**
```
"Good call. They have interest. Following up."
```

SKIP/MINIMIZE:
- [Feature they don't care about]
- [Area not relevant to them]

PROOF POINTS TO USE:
- [Similar customer reference]
- [Relevant case study]

QUESTIONS THEY'LL LIKELY ASK:

ATTENDEES TO ACKNOWLEDGE:

```

### Anti-Patterns

- **No notes** — Relying on memory for complex deals
- **Generic notes** — "Good call, they're interested"
- **CRM as afterthought** — Updating days later with fuzzy recall
- **No quotes captured** — Losing exact customer language
- **Skipping handoff docs** — Expecting others to re-discover
- **Unstructured notes** — Stream of consciousness vs organized template
- **Over-documenting** — 3 pages of notes no one will read
