## SPIN Question Framework

**Impact: CRITICAL**

SPIN Selling is the gold standard for discovery questions. It creates a logical flow from understanding the situation to building urgency for change.

### The SPIN Progression

```
SITUATION → PROBLEM → IMPLICATION → NEED-PAYOFF

"What is..."  "What's hard..."  "What happens..."  "What if..."
```

Each question type builds on the previous, moving the prospect from awareness to urgency.

### Situation Questions

**Purpose:** Establish context and current state
**When:** Early in discovery (first 10 minutes)
**Risk:** Too many = interrogation; too few = assumptions

| Focus Area | Example Questions |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Process** | "Walk me through how your team currently handles..." |
| **Tools** | "What tools or systems are you using for...?" |
| **Team** | "Who on your team is responsible for...?" |
| **History** | "How long have you been doing it this way?" |
| **Metrics** | "How do you measure success in this area?" |

**Good Situation Questions:**
```
"Can you walk me through your current workflow for onboarding new developers?"

"What does your tech stack look like today?"

"How many people touch this process on a weekly basis?"

"What prompted you to take this meeting today?"
```

**Bad Situation Questions:**
```
"What does your company do?"
(Should know from research)

"How many employees do you have?"
(Publicly available information)

"Tell me everything about your business"
(Too broad, lazy)
```

### Problem Questions

**Purpose:** Surface challenges, frustrations, and gaps
**When:** After establishing context
**Tip:** Listen for emotion - frustration indicates real pain

| Problem Type | Example Questions |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Efficiency** | "What takes longer than it should?" |
| **Frustration** | "What's the most frustrating part of that process?" |
| **Gaps** | "Where do things fall through the cracks?" |
| **Workarounds** | "What do you have to do manually that you wish was automated?" |
| **Risk** | "What keeps you up at night about this area?" |

**Good Problem Questions:**
```
"What's the most frustrating part of your current approach?"

"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing, what would it be?"

"Where do you see the biggest gaps in your current process?"

"What's broken that you haven't had time to fix?"
```

**Bad Problem Questions:**
```
"Do you have problems with X?"
(Leading, closed-ended)

"Wouldn't you agree that X is hard?"
(Manipulative)

"Let me tell you the problems you have..."
(Not a question)
```

### Implication Questions

**Purpose:** Quantify the cost of inaction and build urgency
**When:** After identifying problems
**Key:** This is where deals are won or lost

| Impact Area | Example Questions |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Time** | "How much time does that cost your team each week?" |
| **Money** | "What's the financial impact when that happens?" |
| **Risk** | "What's at stake if this doesn't get solved?" |
| **Downstream** | "How does that affect other parts of the business?" |
| **Opportunity** | "What could your team be doing instead?" |

**Good Implication Questions:**
```
"When a secret gets leaked, what's the incident response process?
How many people get pulled in?"

"If you estimate the engineering time spent on this monthly,
what does that translate to in dollars?"

"What happens to your SOC 2 audit if this isn't addressed?"

"How does this problem impact your ability to ship features on time?"
```

**Bad Implication Questions:**
```
"Isn't that a big problem?"
(Leading, doesn't quantify)

"That must be expensive"
(Assumes, doesn't discover)

"You should be worried about that"
(Telling, not asking)
```

### Need-Payoff Questions

**Purpose:** Have the prospect articulate the value of solving the problem
**When:** After implications are established
**Power:** The prospect sells themselves on the solution

| Value Type | Example Questions |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Vision** | "What would it look like if this was solved?" |
| **Impact** | "How would solving this impact your team's productivity?" |
| **Priority** | "Where would this rank against your other initiatives?" |
| **ROI** | "If you could save X hours, what would that be worth?" |
| **Future** | "What becomes possible when this is no longer a problem?" |

**Good Need-Payoff Questions:**
```
"If you could reduce that incident response time by 80%,
what would that mean for your team?"

"Imagine having full visibility into every secret across your infrastructure.
How would that change your security posture?"

"If this problem was solved, what could your engineers focus on instead?"

"What would it mean for your SOC 2 audit to have this fully automated?"
```

**Bad Need-Payoff Questions:**
```
"Wouldn't it be great if..."
(Rhetorical, not discovery)

"Let me tell you how our product solves this"
(Pitching, not questioning)

"You need a solution like ours"
(Presumptuous)
```

### SPIN Sequencing Example

```
Situation:
"Walk me through how your team manages secrets today."
Response: "We use .env files and have some stuff in a shared vault."

Problem:
"What happens when someone joins or leaves the team?"
Response: "It's a mess. We have to rotate everything manually."

Implication:
"How often does that happen with your growth rate?
And what's the risk if a credential doesn't get rotated?"
Response: "Monthly. And honestly, we've had a few close calls."

Need-Payoff:
"If you had automated rotation and complete audit trails,
how would that affect your confidence in security?"
Response: "It would be huge. I'd actually sleep at night."
```

### Question Density Guidelines

| Call Length | Situation | Problem | Implication | Need-Payoff |
|-------------|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **30 min** | 3-4 | 3-4 | 2-3 | 2-3 |
| **45 min** | 4-5 | 4-5 | 3-4 | 3-4 |
| **60 min** | 5-6 | 5-6 | 4-5 | 4-5 |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Skipping to Need-Payoff** — Can't propose solutions before understanding problems
- **All Situation** — Spending entire call on context without finding pain
- **No Implications** — Finding problems but not quantifying impact
- **Rapid-fire questions** — No pauses for prospect to elaborate
- **Leading questions** — "Don't you think X is a problem?"
- **Closed questions only** — Yes/no answers don't reveal insight
