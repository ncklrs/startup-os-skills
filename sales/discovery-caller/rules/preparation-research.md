### Hypothesis Development

Build 2-3 hypotheses before every call:

**Template:**
```
Based on [research finding], I hypothesize that [prospect name]
is struggling with [problem] which is causing [business impact].

Research Finding: Series B startup, grew from 20 to 80 employees in 12 months
Hypothesis: Rapid growth has likely outpaced their security infrastructure.
They're probably managing secrets manually or with basic tools that don't scale.

Validation Question: "With your team tripling in size, how has your
approach to secrets management evolved?"
```

### Good Preparation Examples

```
Before a call with a Series B fintech CTO:

Research:
- Company raised $25M 6 months ago
- CTO posted about SOC 2 compliance on LinkedIn
- Job postings show they're hiring DevOps
- Using AWS based on job descriptions

Hypotheses:
1. SOC 2 audit driving security improvements
2. Growing team means access management challenges
3. Moving fast but worried about compliance

Prepared Questions:
- "I noticed you're going through SOC 2. How is that going?"
- "With the DevOps hiring, how are you managing secrets at scale?"
- "What triggered the focus on compliance now?"
```

### Bad Preparation Examples

```
Showing up with:
- "So, tell me about your company"
  (Should already know this)

- "What does your company do?"
  (Wastes their time, shows laziness)

- "I see you work at Acme Corp"
  (That's not research, that's reading)

- Generic pitch deck with no customization
  (One-size-fits-all doesn't fit anyone)
```

### Agenda Setting

Send a brief agenda 24 hours before:

**Good Agenda:**
```
Subject: Agenda for Tomorrow - [Your Company] + [Their Company]

Hi [Name],

Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow. Here's what I'd like to cover:

1. Learn about your current [relevant area] and key priorities (15 min)
2. Understand what's working and what's challenging (15 min)
3. Determine if there's a fit and discuss next steps (10 min)

I've done some research on [Company] and have a few specific questions,
but I'd love to hear what's top of mind for you. Is there anything
specific you'd like to cover?

Best,
[Name]
```

**Bad Agenda:**
```
Subject: Meeting tomorrow

Hi,

Excited to tell you about our product tomorrow. I'll show you a demo
and explain our pricing.

See you then!
```

### Pre-Call Mental Preparation

Five minutes before the call:
1. Review your hypotheses
2. Have your top 5 questions visible
3. Open note-taking tool
4. Close distractions (email, Slack)
5. Take a breath - be genuinely curious

### Anti-Patterns

- **Zero preparation** — "So tell me about yourself" opening
- **Research overload** — Spending 2 hours on a 30-minute call
- **Stalker vibes** — "I saw you went to Hawaii last week" (creepy)
- **No hypotheses** — Going in without informed guesses to validate
- **Generic questions** — Same questions regardless of prospect
- **No agenda sent** — Prospect doesn't know what to expect
