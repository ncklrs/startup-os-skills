## Competitive Discovery

**Impact: HIGH**

Knowing your competition in a deal changes everything - your positioning, urgency, and strategy. Discover early, differentiate strategically.

### Why Competitive Discovery Matters

```
WITH COMPETITION:                  WITHOUT COMPETITION:
- Faster decision timeline         - Slower, less urgent
- Forced comparison               - Evaluated in isolation
- Higher risk of loss             - Lower risk
- Differentiation critical        - Features focus
- Price pressure                  - Value conversation
```

### Questions to Uncover Competition

**Direct questions:**
```
"Are you evaluating any other solutions alongside us?"

"Who else is on your shortlist?"

"What alternatives have you looked at?"

"Is there an incumbent solution you're comparing us to?"
```

**Indirect questions:**
```
"What does your research process look like so far?"

"What other approaches are you considering for solving this?"

"How did you hear about us and who else came up in your research?"

"Have you seen any demos or had conversations with other vendors?"
```

**Timing questions:**
```
"Where are you in conversations with other vendors?"

"When are you looking to make a final decision?"

"Are you at a similar stage with other solutions?"
```

### Competitive Landscape Framework

| Competitor Type | Definition | Strategy |
|-----------------|------------|----------|
| **Direct** | Same product category | Differentiate on key capabilities |
| **Indirect** | Different approach, same problem | Position your category |
| **Status Quo** | Doing nothing / manual process | Create urgency, quantify cost |
| **DIY** | Build vs buy | Highlight hidden costs of building |
| **Incumbent** | Current vendor | Focus on gaps, switching value |

```

### When They're Evaluating Competitors

**Discovery questions:**
```
"What criteria are you using to evaluate solutions?"

"What's most important to you in making this decision?"

"Where do you see the biggest differences between options?"

"What would make one solution stand out over another?"

"What concerns do you have about each option you're considering?"
```

**Positioning questions:**
```
"Based on what you've seen so far, where do you think we might
have an advantage?"

"Is there anything you've seen elsewhere that you wish we had?"

"What would you want to see to feel confident in choosing us?"
```

### Competitive Differentiation Conversation

**Framework: Acknowledge → Bridge → Differentiate**

```
Acknowledge: "Yes, [Competitor] is a solid company and I understand
why they're on your list."

Bridge: "The key difference I've seen with customers who choose
us over them..."

Differentiate: "Is that [specific differentiator] matters when
[specific use case]. How important is that for you?"
```

**Good differentiation:**
```
"Where we see customers choose us over [Competitor] is when they
need [specific capability]. For example, [Customer X] came to us
specifically because [reason]. How relevant is that to your situation?"
```

**Bad differentiation:**
```
"They're not as good as us." (No specifics)

"Their product is buggy." (Negative, unsubstantiated)

"We're the market leader." (Irrelevant to their needs)

"Let me tell you everything wrong with them." (Comes across desperate)
```

### Handling the "We're Looking at Others" Response

**Positive framing:**
```
Prospect: "We're also looking at HashiCorp and AWS Secrets Manager."

Rep: "That makes sense - both solid options. I'm curious, what drew
you to include us in the evaluation? Understanding that helps me
focus on what's most relevant for you."
```

**Going deeper:**
```
"What criteria matter most to you in comparing these options?"

"Have you had a chance to see demos of both yet?"

"Where do you see the biggest differences so far?"

"Is there a front-runner at this point, or are you still
gathering information?"
```

### Status Quo Competition

Often the biggest competitor is "doing nothing."

**Discovery questions:**
```
"What happens if you don't solve this in the next 6 months?"

"What's keeping this from being a higher priority?"

"What would need to change for this to become urgent?"

"Have you tried to solve this before? What happened?"
```

**Creating urgency:**
```
"Based on the $150K annual cost we calculated, every month you
wait is roughly $12K. What would need to be true for this to
become a priority this quarter?"
```

### DIY Competition (Build vs. Buy)

**Discovery questions:**
```
"Is building a solution in-house on the table?"

"What would it take to build this internally?"

"Have you estimated the time and cost to build?"

"Who would maintain it long-term?"
```

**Build vs. Buy Comparison:**

| Factor | Build In-House | Buy Solution |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Initial cost** | Engineering time (6-12 months) | Subscription cost |
| **Time to value** | 6-12+ months | Days to weeks |
| **Maintenance** | Ongoing engineering burden | Vendor responsibility |
| **Features** | Only what you build | Full platform |
| **Opportunity cost** | Engineers not on core product | None |

**Positioning against DIY:**
```
"Some companies do consider building. What we typically see is that
the initial build takes 6+ months, then requires 1-2 engineers
maintaining it forever. When you factor in opportunity cost -
what else those engineers could build - it's usually 3-5x the
cost of buying. Have you done that calculation?"
```

### Competitive Intelligence Tracking

**After every call, document:**
```
COMPETITIVE INTEL: [Company Name]

Competitors mentioned: [HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager]

Stage with competitors:
- HashiCorp: Had one demo, scheduling technical deep-dive
- AWS: Researching, no demo yet

Decision criteria shared:
1. Ease of use
2. Integration with existing stack
3. Price

Differentiators that resonate:
- Our developer experience
- Faster implementation

Concerns about us:
- Less known brand than competitors

Next steps:
- Send competitive one-pager
- Prep for technical deep-dive against HashiCorp
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Ignoring competition** — "We don't have competitors" (unrealistic)
- **Badmouthing competitors** — Makes you look insecure
- **Not asking** — Assuming you know who they're evaluating
- **Generic differentiation** — "We're better" without specifics
- **Competing on price alone** — Race to the bottom
- **Late discovery** — Finding out about competitor in negotiation
