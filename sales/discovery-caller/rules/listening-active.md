## Active Listening Techniques

**Impact: HIGH**

Active listening is the difference between a conversation and an interrogation. It builds trust, uncovers deeper insights, and makes prospects feel heard.

### The 70/30 Rule

**Target: Prospect talks 70%, you talk 30%**

### The LAER Framework

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **L** | Listen | Fully focus on what they're saying |
| **A** | Acknowledge | Show you heard and understood |
| **E** | Explore | Go deeper with follow-up questions |
| **R** | Respond | Add value or transition |

### Active Listening Behaviors

**Do:**
- Maintain eye contact (on video)
- Nod and use verbal affirmations ("I see", "That makes sense")
- Take notes visibly (shows you value what they say)
- Pause before responding (process what was said)
- Paraphrase back key points

**Don't:**
- Interrupt
- Multitask (check email, Slack)
- Plan your response while they're talking
- Jump to solution mode
- Dismiss or minimize their concerns

### Clarification Techniques

**Paraphrasing:**
```
"So if I'm hearing you correctly, [restate their point]. Is that right?"

"It sounds like the core challenge is [summary]. Am I on track?"

"Let me make sure I understand - you're saying [paraphrase]?"
```

**Reflection:**
```
"It sounds like that's been really frustrating for you."

"I can hear how important this is to the team."

"That seems like a significant concern."
```

**Probing:**
```
"Tell me more about that."

"What do you mean by [specific term they used]?"

"Can you give me an example?"

"What happened next?"
```

### Digging Deeper: The 5 Whys

When you hit a surface-level answer, keep going:

```
Statement: "We need better security."

Why 1: "Why is security a priority right now?"
Answer: "We had an incident last month."

Why 2: "What happened in that incident?"
Answer: "A developer accidentally pushed a key to GitHub."

Why 3: "What was the impact?"
Answer: "We had to rotate 50+ credentials over a weekend."

Why 4: "What did that cost in terms of time and resources?"
Answer: "About 40 engineering hours plus the stress."

Why 5: "What would have prevented that?"
Answer: "Automated scanning and secrets management."

→ Now you have: quantified pain, specific use case, and stated need
```

### Reading Between the Lines

**What they say vs. what they mean:**

| They Say | Might Mean | Follow-up |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| "We're looking at a few options" | Competition is in play | "Who else are you evaluating?" |
| "This is on our roadmap" | Not urgent priority | "Where does this rank vs other priorities?" |
| "I need to loop in my team" | Not the decision maker | "Who else would be involved in this decision?" |
| "Send me some information" | Trying to end the call | "What specific information would be most helpful?" |
| "We tried something similar before" | Past failure, skepticism | "What happened with that? What would need to be different?" |
| "Price is important to us" | Budget constrained | "What budget range are you working within?" |

### Silence as a Tool

**Strategic pauses:**
- After asking a question: Wait 3-5 seconds before filling silence
- After they finish speaking: Pause before responding
- When they give a short answer: Stay silent; they often elaborate

```
Rep: "What's the biggest challenge you're facing?"
Prospect: "Time."
Rep: [Silence - waits 4 seconds]
Prospect: "I mean, specifically, my team is spending 20 hours a week
on manual processes that should be automated, and it's killing our
velocity."

→ The silence drew out the real answer
```

### Note-Taking Best Practices

**What to capture:**
- Direct quotes (exact words they use)
- Numbers and metrics mentioned
- Names of people and tools
- Emotion indicators (frustrated, excited, worried)
- Questions to follow up on

**Note structure:**
```
CALL: Discovery - Acme Corp
DATE: 2024-01-15
ATTENDEES: Jane Smith (VP Eng), John Doe (DevOps Lead)

SITUATION:
- 80 engineers, growing to 120 by Q2
- Using HashiCorp Vault (self-hosted)
- Manual rotation process

PAIN POINTS:
- "Rotation takes 20 hours/month" (Jane's words)
- Recent audit flagged secrets management
- Two incidents in last 6 months

IMPACT:
- $15k/month in engineering time (calculated)
- SOC 2 audit at risk
- "I can't sleep before an audit" - Jane

NEXT STEPS:
- Demo scheduled for Tuesday
- John to bring Security Lead
- Send ROI calculator
```

### Red Flags in Listening

| Signal | What It Might Indicate | How to Address |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|
| Short answers | Disengaged or guarded | Ask more open-ended questions |
| Checking time/phone | Not interested | "I want to respect your time - should we reschedule?" |
| Vague responses | Doesn't know or doesn't want to share | "Help me understand what you mean by..." |
| Deflecting questions | May not be the right person | "Who else might have visibility into this?" |
| Excessive positivity | May be avoiding real issues | "What would make this even better?" |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Listening to respond** — Planning your next question instead of hearing them
- **Interrupting with solutions** — "Oh, we can solve that!" before they finish
- **Ignoring emotion** — Missing frustration or excitement cues
- **No follow-up** — Accepting surface answers without exploring
- **Distracted listening** — Multitasking during calls
- **Confirmation bias** — Only hearing what supports your hypothesis
