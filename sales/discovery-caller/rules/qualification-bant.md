## Budget and Timeline Qualification

**Impact: CRITICAL**

Qualification separates real opportunities from time-wasters. Don't invest cycles in deals that won't close.

### Qualification Framework Comparison

| Framework | Best For | Components |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **BANT** | SMB, faster sales cycles | Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline |
| **MEDDIC** | Enterprise, complex deals | Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion |
| **SPICED** | Modern SaaS | Situation, Pain, Impact, Critical Event, Decision |
| **CHAMP** | Customer-centric | Challenges, Authority, Money, Prioritization |

### Budget Qualification

**The goal:** Understand if they can afford your solution and if it's a priority for their budget.

**Direct Questions:**
```
"What budget has been allocated for solving this problem?"

"Where would funding for this come from - existing budget or new request?"

"What's the typical range you spend on solutions like this?"

"If this became a priority, what investment level would make sense?"
```

**Indirect Questions:**
```
"What are you currently spending on [related area]?"

"When you've invested in solutions like this before,
what was the typical price range?"

"How do you typically evaluate ROI for purchases in this area?"
```

**Budget Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Signal | Next Step |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Has budget allocated | Strong | Confirm amount, move forward |
| Budget exists but not allocated | Medium | Help them build business case |
| No budget, but can request | Medium | ROI calculator, champion building |
| No budget, can't request | Weak | Nurture for future, deprioritize |
| Won't discuss budget | Unknown | Build more trust, revisit later |

**Budget Qualification Matrix:**

```
                    Budget Available
                    YES         NO
                ┌─────────┬─────────┐
         YES    │ IDEAL   │ HELP    │
Can              │ DEAL    │ BUILD   │
Request         │ FAST    │ CASE    │
                ├─────────┼─────────┤
         NO     │ FIND    │ NURTURE │
                │ SPONSOR │ ONLY    │
                └─────────┴─────────┘
```

### Timeline Qualification

**The goal:** Understand when they need to make a decision and what's driving urgency.

**Key Questions:**
```
"When are you looking to have a solution in place?"

"What's driving that timeline?"

"What happens if this doesn't get solved by [date]?"

"Is there a specific event or deadline creating urgency?"

"Where does this sit relative to other priorities this quarter?"
```

**Timeline Indicators:**

| Signal | Urgency Level | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Specific date mentioned | HIGH | Real deadline exists |
| "This quarter" | MEDIUM-HIGH | Active priority |
| "This year" | MEDIUM | On radar but not urgent |
| "When we get around to it" | LOW | No urgency, deprioritize |
| External deadline (audit, renewal) | HIGH | Hard deadline driving action |
| Internal deadline (OKR, project) | MEDIUM | Could slip |

**Critical Events to Discover:**

```
EXTERNAL (Hard deadlines):
- Compliance audits (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR)
- Contract renewals
- Board meetings
- Funding rounds
- Product launches

INTERNAL (Soft deadlines):
- Quarterly planning
- Budget cycles
- Headcount changes
- Strategic initiatives
- Executive mandates
```

### Authority Qualification

**The goal:** Understand who makes the decision and your contact's role.

**Questions:**
```
"Walk me through how decisions like this typically get made."

"Who else would be involved in evaluating and approving this?"

"If you found a solution you loved, what would the process look like?"

"Who owns the budget for this area?"

"Have you purchased something similar before? How did that process go?"
```

**Stakeholder Roles:**

| Role | Question to Ask | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Economic Buyer** | "Who ultimately signs off on purchases like this?" | Must be involved or deal stalls |
| **Champion** | "Who internally is most motivated to solve this?" | Drives internal momentum |
| **Technical Evaluator** | "Who will assess the technical fit?" | Can veto on technical grounds |
| **End Users** | "Who will be using this day-to-day?" | Adoption depends on their buy-in |
| **Blocker** | "Who might have concerns about a change like this?" | Address objections early |

### Need Qualification

**The goal:** Confirm the problem is real, significant, and solvable by your product.

**Questions:**
```
"On a scale of 1-10, how painful is this problem today?"

"What would happen if you did nothing for 6 months?"

"How does this compare to other challenges you're facing?"

"Is solving this a 'must-have' or 'nice-to-have'?"

"What would success look like if this was solved?"
```

**Need Assessment Matrix:**

| Pain Level | Business Impact | Priority |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| HIGH pain + HIGH impact | URGENT - fast track |
| HIGH pain + LOW impact | MEDIUM - prove ROI |
| LOW pain + HIGH impact | MEDIUM - create urgency |
| LOW pain + LOW impact | LOW - nurture or disqualify |

### Qualification Scoring

**Simple Qualification Score:**

| Factor | Strong (3) | Medium (2) | Weak (1) |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Budget** | Allocated | Can request | None |
| **Authority** | Decision maker | Influencer | Unknown |
| **Need** | Urgent pain | Acknowledged | Unclear |
| **Timeline** | <30 days | <90 days | >90 days |

**Total Score:**
- 10-12: Hot - prioritize heavily
- 7-9: Warm - active opportunity
- 4-6: Cool - qualify further or nurture
- 1-3: Cold - deprioritize or disqualify

### Disqualification Criteria

**Hard disqualifiers:**
- No budget and no path to budget
- No authority and won't involve decision makers
- Problem you can't solve
- Timeline >12 months with no driver
- Current contract with competitor (long remaining)

**When to disqualify gracefully:**
```
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [problem] isn't
the top priority right now. I don't want to waste your time -
would it make sense to reconnect in [timeframe] when this
becomes more urgent?"

"It sounds like you're earlier in this journey than our typical
customers. Can I share some resources and check back in Q3?"
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Avoiding budget conversations** — Feels awkward but essential
- **Accepting "we'll find budget"** — Press for specifics
- **Believing timeline without drivers** — "This quarter" means nothing without a why
- **Single-threading authority** — Always ask who else is involved
- **Not disqualifying** — Hoping bad deals become good
- **Qualification once** — Should revisit throughout deal cycle
